# Notes on Scrambled Markov Clustering

I'm looking further into the clustering of nodes in the Scrambled Oracle
Markov chains. I want to find some kind of insight into the formation
of the chains by understanding what puts all of these peices together.

It is also an interesting engineering challenge.

My initial analysis on connected components in the generated Markov
chains produced a regular pattern. Without fail, the bulk of the nodes
were part of a single graph, with tiny stragglers in the form of single
sentences or sentence fragments.

In other words, even combining vastly different kinds of literature, the
shared constraints of form in the English language were enough that at
some point (often at several points I suspect) some three or four word
sequence appears in both documents.

This is not inconceivable.
