#  I Write Ransom Notes 
Okay, not ACTUAL ransom notes, but the engine takes existing text and attempts to use the pattens in it to assemble new patterns 
based on a certain number of prefix words.  It reassembles full sequences, verifies that they are not just full quotes of existing 
text, and then autoposts them to twitter using a prestablished Twitter Application.
