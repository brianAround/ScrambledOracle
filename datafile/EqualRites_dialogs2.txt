( 0 ) EQUAL RITES
by Terry Pratchett
( 1 ) I would like it to be clearly understood that this
( 2 ) book is not wacky.|Only dumb redheads in
( 3 ) Fifties" sitcoms are wacky.
( 4 ) No, it's not zany, either.
( 5 ) This is a story about magic and where it goes and perhaps more importantly where it comes from and why, although it doesn't pretend to answer all or any of these questions.
( 6 ) It may, however, help to explain why Gandalf never got married and why Merlin was a man.|Because this is also a story about sex, although probably not in the athletic, tumbling, count-the-legs-and-divide-by-two sense unless the characters get totally beyond the author's control.|They might.
( 7 ) However, it is primarily a story about a world.|Here it comes now.|Watch closely, the special effects are quite expensive.
( 8 ) A bass note sounds.|It is a deep, vibrating chord that hints that the brass section may break in at any moment with a fanfare for the cosmos, because the scene is the blackness of deep space with a few stars glittering like the dandruff on the shoulders of God.
( 9 ) Then it comes into view overhead, bigger than the biggest, most unpleasantly armed starcruiser in the imagination of a three-ring filmmaker: a turtle, ten thousand miles long.|It is Great A'Tuin, one of the rare astrochelonians from a universe where things are less as they are and more like people imagine them to be, and it carries on its meteor-pocked shell four giant elephants who bear on their enormous shoulders the great round wheel of the Discworld.
( 10 ) As the viewpoint swings around, the whole of the world can be seen by the light of its tiny orbiting sun.|There are continents, archipelagos, seas, deserts, mountain ranges and even a tiny central ice cap.|The inhabitants of this place, it is obvious, won't have any truck with global theories.|Their world, bounded by an encircling ocean that falls forever into space in one long waterfall, is as round and flat as a geological pizza, although without the anchovies.
( 11 ) A world like that, which exists only because the gods enjoy a joke, must be a place where magic can survive.|And sex too, of course.
( 12 ) He came walking through the thunderstorm and you could tell he was a wizard, partly because of the long cloak and carven staff but mainly because the raindrops were stopping several feet from his head, and steaming.
( 13 ) It was good thunderstorm country, up here in the Ramtop Mountains, a country of jagged peaks, dense forests and little river valleys so deep the daylight had no sooner reached the bottom than it was time to leave again.|Ragged wisps of cloud clung to the lesser peaks below the mountain trail along which the wizard slithered and slid.|A few slot-eyed goats watched him with mild interest.|It doesn't take a lot to interest goats.
( 14 ) Sometimes he would stop and throw his heavy staff into the air.|It always came down pointing the same way and the wizard would sigh, pick it up, and continue his squelchy progress.
( 15 ) The storm walked around the hills on legs of lightning, shouting and grumbling.
( 16 ) The wizard disappeared around the bend in the track and the goats went back to their damp grazing.
( 17 ) Until something else caused them to look up.|They stiffened, their eyes widening, their nostrils flaring.
( 18 ) This was strange, because there was nothing on the path.|But the goats still watched it pass by until it was out of sight.
( 19 ) There was a village tucked in a narrow valley between steep woods.|It wasn't a large village, and wouldn't have shown up on a map of the mountains.|It barely showed up on a map of the village.
( 20 ) It was, in fact, one of those places that exist merely so that people can have come from them.|The universe is littered with them: hidden villages, windswept little towns under wide skies, isolated cabins on chilly mountains, whose only mark on history is to be the incredibly ordinary place where something extraordinary started to happen.|Often there is no more than a little plaque to reveal that, against all gynecological probability, someone very famous was born halfway up a wall.
( 21 ) Mist curled between the houses as the wizard crossed a narrow bridge over the swollen stream and made his way to the village smithy, although the two facts had nothing to do with one another.|The mist would have curled anyway: it was experienced mist and had got curling down to a fine art.
( 22 ) The smithy was fairly crowded, of course.|A smithy is one place where you can depend on finding a good fire and someone to talk to.|Several villagers were lounging in the warm shadows but, as the wizard approached, they sat up expectantly and tried to look intelligent, generally with indifferent success.
( 23 ) The smith didn't feel the need to be quite so subservient.|He nodded at the wizard, but it was a greeting between equals, or at least between equals as far as the smith was concerned.|After all, any halfway competent blacksmith has more than a nodding acquaintance with magic, or at least likes to think he has.
( 24 ) The wizard bowed.|A white cat that had been sleeping by the furnace woke up and watched him carefully.
( 25 ) "What is the name of this place, sir?"|said the wizard.
WIZARD :	 What is the name of this place , sir ?

( 26 ) The blacksmith shrugged.
( 27 ) "Bad Ass," he said.

( 29 ) "Ass," repeated the blacksmith, his tone defying anyone to make something of it.
BLACKSMITH :	 Ass ,

( 30 ) The wizard considered this.
( 31 ) "A name with a story behind it," he said at last, "which were circumstances otherwise I would be pleased to hear.|But I would like to speak to you, smith, about your son."
WIZARD :	 A name with a story behind it , which were circumstances otherwise I would be pleased to hear . But I would like to speak to you , smith , about your son .

( 32 ) "Which one?"|said the smith, and the hangers-on sniggered.|The wizard smiled.

( 34 ) The smith's face stiffened.|He turned to the other villagers.
( 35 ) "All right, the rain's stopping," he said.|"Piss off, the lot of you.|Me and-" he looked at the wizard with raised eyebrows.
SMITH :	 All right , the rain 's stopping , Piss off , the lot of you . Me and-

( 37 ) "Me and Mr. Billet have things to talk about."|He waved his hammer vaguely and, one after another, craning over their shoulders in case the wizard did anything interesting, the audience departed.
SMITH :	 Me and Mr. Billet have things to talk about .

( 38 ) The smith drew a couple of stools from under a bench.|He took a bottle out of a cupboard by the water tank and poured a couple of very small glasses of clear liquid.
( 39 ) The two men sat and watched the rain and the mist rolling over the bridge.|Then the smith said: "I know what son you mean.|Old Granny is up with my wife now.|Eighth son of an eighth son, of course.|It did cross my mind but I never gave it much thought, to be honest.|Well, well.|A wizard in the family, eh?"
BLACKSMITH :	 I know what son you mean . Old Granny is up with my wife now . Eighth son of an eighth son , of course . It did cross my mind but I never gave it much thought , to be honest . Well , well . A wizard in the family , eh ?

( 40 ) "You catch on very quickly," said Billet.|The white cat jumped down from its perch, sauntered across the floor and vaulted into the wizard's lap, where it curled up.|His thin fingers stroked it absentmindedly.
BILLET :	 You catch on very quickly ,

( 42 ) "Possibly, possibly," said Billet.|"Of course, he'll have to go to University first.|He may do very well, of course."

( 43 ) The smith considered the idea from all angles, and decided he liked it a lot.|A thought struck him.
( 44 ) "Hang on," he said.|"I'm trying to remember what my father told me.|A wizard who knows he's going to die can sort of pass on his sort of wizardness to a sort of successor, right?"

( 46 ) "So you're going to sort of die?"

( 47 ) "Oh yes."|The cat purred as the fingers tickled it behind the ear.

( 52 ) The blacksmith considered this.|"Who told you?"|he said at last.
BLACKSMITH :	 Who told you ?
mentioned_person ['Hang'] recent_person: he wizard smith blacksmith he

( 53 ) The wizard pretended not to hear him.|He was watching the bridge, looking for telltale turbulence in the mist.
( 54 ) "Look," said the smith.|"You'd better tell me how we go about bringing up a wizard, you see, because there isn't a wizard in these parts and-"
BLACKSMITH :	 Look , You 'd better tell me how we go about bringing up a wizard , you see , because there is n't a wizard in these parts and-

( 55 ) "It will all sort itself out," said Billet pleasantly.|"The magic has guided me to you and the magic will take care of everything.|It usually does.|Did I hear a cry?"

( 56 ) The blacksmith looked at the ceiling.|Above the splash of the rain he could make out the sound of a pair of new lungs at full bore.
( 57 ) The wizard smiled.|"Have him brought down here," he said.
WIZARD :	 Have him brought down here ,
mentioned_person ['Did'] recent_person: Billet blacksmith wizard wizard he

( 58 ) The cat sat up and looked interestedly at the forge's wide doorway.|As the smith called excitedly up the stairs it jumped down and padded slowly across the floor, purring like a bandsaw.
( 59 ) A tall white-haired woman appeared at the bottom of the stairs, clutching a bundle in a blanket.|The smith hurried her over to where the wizard sat.
( 60 ) "But-" she began.
SMITH :	 But-

( 62 ) The wizard held up his staff.|It was man-high and nearly as thick as his wrist, and covered with carvings that seemed to change as the smith looked at them, exactly as if they didn't want him to see what they were.
( 63 ) "The child must hold it," said Drum Billet.|The smith nodded, and fumbled in the blanket until he located a tiny pink hand.|He guided it gently to the wood.|It gripped it tightly.

( 66 ) The wizard was silent.

( 68 ) The smith pushed the baby back into the arms of the frantic midwife.|Then, as respectfully as possible, he unpried the thin, pale fingers from the staff.
( 69 ) It had a strange, greasy feel, like static electricity.|The wood itself was almost black, but the carvings were slightly lighter, and hurt the eyes if you tried to make out precisely what they were supposed to be.
( 70 ) "Are you pleased with yourself?"|said the midwife.
MIDWIFE :	 Are you pleased with yourself ?

( 78 ) "What have I done?"|he moaned.
SMITH :	 What have I done ?

( 79 ) "You've given the world its first female wizard," said the midwife.|"Whosa itsywitsy, den?"

( 82 ) The white cat purred and arched its back as if it was rubbing up against the legs of an old friend.|Which was odd, because there was no one there.
( 83 ) "I was foolish," said a voice in tones no mortal could hear.|"I assumed the magic would know what it was doing."

( 86 ) THERE IS NO GOING BACK.|THERE IS NO GOING BACK, said the deep, heavy voice like the closing of crypt doors.
( 87 ) The wisp of nothingness that was Drum Billet thought for a while.
( 88 ) "But she's going to have a lot of problems."

( 91 ) Death hesitated.
( 92 ) YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT, he said.|TAKE IT FROM ME.

DEATH :	 I 've heard that some people do it all the time .

( 94 ) YOU'VE GOT TO BE TRAINED TO IT.|YOU'VE GOT TO START OFF SMALL AND WORK UP.|YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW HORRIBLE IT IS TO BE AN ANT.

DEATH :	 It 's bad ?
mentioned_person ['Whosa'] recent_person: Drum Billet Billet Death he

( 96 ) YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.|AND WITH YOUR KARMA AN ANT IS TOO MUCH TO EXPECT.
( 97 ) The baby had been taken back to its mother and the smith sat disconsolately watching the rain.
( 98 ) Drum Billet scratched the cat behind its ears and thought about his life.|It had been a long one, that was one of the advantages of being a wizard, and he'd done a lot of things he hadn't always felt good about.|It was about time that...
( 99 ) I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY, YOU KNOW, said Death, reproachfully.
( 100 ) The wizard looked down at the cat and realized for the first time how odd it looked now.
( 101 ) The living often don't appreciate how complicated the world looks when you are dead, because while death frees the mind from the straitjacket of three dimensions it also cuts it away from Time, which is only another dimension.|So while the cat that rubbed up against his invisible legs was undoubtedly the same cat that he had seen a few minutes before, it was also quite clearly a tiny kitten and a fat, half-blind old moggy and every stage in between.|All at once.|Since it had started off small it looked like a white, cat-shaped carrot, a description that will have to do until people invent proper four-dimensional adjectives.
( 102 ) Death's skeletal hand tapped Billet gently on the shoulder.
( 103 ) COME AWAY, MY SON.
( 104 ) "There's nothing I can do?"
BILLET :	 There 's nothing I can do ?
mentioned_person ['Whosa'] recent_person: Time he Death Death Billet

YOU :	 Yes . There is that .

( 107 ) The midwife's name was Granny Weatherwax.|She was a witch.|That was quite acceptable in the Ramtops, and no one had a bad word to say about witches.|At least, not if he wanted to wake up in the morning the same shape as he went to bed.
( 108 ) The smith was still staring gloomily at the rain when she came back down the stairs and clapped a warty hand on his shoulder.
( 109 ) He looked up at her.
( 110 ) "What shall I do, Granny?"|he said, unable to keep the pleading out of his voice.
SMITH :	 What shall I do , Granny ?

( 114 ) They both turned to stare at the heavy staff, which the smith had propped in the forge's darkest corner.|It almost appeared to be looking back at them.

( 120 ) Granny Weatherwax swung shut the big doors and turned to him angrily.
( 121 ) "Now you listen to me, Gordo Smith!"|she said.|"Female wizards aren't right either!|It's the wrong kind of magic for women, is wizard magic, it's all books and stars and jommetry.|She'd never grasp it.|Whoever heard of a female wizard?"

( 134 ) The tone of her voice suggested that it would be a very good idea not to disobey.|Smith rummaged desperately among the junk at the back of the forge until he found an old double-headed ax.

( 136 ) "Why?|What do you intend to do?"|said the smith, who was beginning to lose his grip on events.|Granny gave an exasperated sigh.

( 138 ) Smith struggled out of the heavy leather apron and handed it to her very gingerly.|She wrapped it around the ax and made one or two passes in the air.|Then, a spiderlike figure in the glow of the nearly incandescent furnace, she stalked across the room and with a grunt of triumph and effort brought the heavy blade sweeping down right in the center of the staff.
( 139 ) There was a click.|There was a noise like a partridge.|There was a thud.
( 140 ) There was silence.
( 141 ) Smith reached up very slowly, without moving his head, and touched the ax blade.|It wasn't on the ax anymore.|It had buried itself in the door by his head, taking a tiny nick out of his ear.
( 142 ) Granny stood looking slightly blurred from hitting an absolutely immovable object, and stared at the stub of wood in her hands.

( 158 ) Later, night fell gently as the last of the world's slow light flowed out of the valley, and a pale, rain-washed moon shone down in a night studded with stars.|And in a shadowy orchard behind the forge there was the occasional clink of a spade or a muffled curse.
( 159 ) In the cradle upstairs the world's first female wizard dreamed of nothing much.
( 160 ) The white cat lay half-asleep on its private ledge near the furnace.|The only sound in the warm dark forge was the crackle of the coals as they settled down under the ash.
( 161 ) The staff stood in the corner, where it wanted to be, wrapped in shadows that were slightly blacker than shadows normally are.
( 162 ) Time passed, which, basically, is its job.
( 163 ) There was a faint tinkle, and a swish of air.|After a while the cat sat up and watched with interest.
( 164 ) Dawn came.|Up here in the Ramtops dawn was always impressive, especially when a storm had cleared the air.|The valley occupied by Bad Ass overlooked a panorama of lesser mountains and foothills, colored purple and orange in the early morning light that flowed gently over them (because light travels at a dilatory pace in the Disc's vast magical field) and far off the great plains were still a puddle of shadows.|Even further off the sea gave an occasional distant sparkle.
( 165 ) In fact, from here you could see right to the edge of the world.
( 166 ) That wasn't poetic imagery but plain fact, since the world was quite definitely flat and was, furthermore, known to be carried through space on the backs of four elephants that in turn stood on the shell of Great A'Tuin, the Great Sky Turtle.
( 167 ) Back down there in Bad Ass the village is waking up.|The smith has just gone into the forge and found it tidier than it has been for the last hundred years, with all the tools back in their right places, the floor swept and a new fire laid in the furnace.|He is sitting on the anvil, which has been moved right across the room, and is watching the staff and is trying to think.
( 168 ) Nothing much happened for seven years, except that one of the apple trees in the smithy orchard grew perceptibly taller than the others and was frequently climbed by a small girl with brown hair, a gap in her front teeth, and the sort of features that promised to become, if not beautiful, then at least attractively interesting.
( 169 ) She was named Eskarina, for no particular reason other than that her mother liked the sound of the word, and although Granny Weatherwax kept a careful watch on her she failed to spot any signs of magic whatsoever.|It was true that the girl spent more time climbing trees and running around shouting than little girls normally did, but a girl with four older brothers still at home can be excused a lot of things.|In fact, the witch began to relax and started to think the magic had not taken hold after all.
( 170 ) But magic has a habit of lying low, like a rake in the grass.
( 171 ) Winter came round again, and it was a bad one.|The clouds hung around the Ramtops like big fat sheep, filling the gulleys with snow and turning the forests into silent, gloomy caverns.|The high passes were closed and the caravans wouldn't come again until spring.|Bad Ass became a little island of heat and light.
( 172 ) Over breakfast Esk's mother said: "I'm worried about Granny Weatherwax.|She hasn't been around lately."

( 183 ) Smith reached down and slapped her.|It wasn't very hard, and he regretted it instantly.|The boys got the flat of his hand and occasionally the length of his belt whenever they deserved it.|The trouble with his daughter, though, was not ordinary naughtiness but the infuriating way she had of relentlessly pursuing the thread of an argument long after she should have put it down.|It always flustered him.
( 184 ) She burst into tears.|Smith stood up, angry and embarrassed at himself, and stumped off to the forge.
( 185 ) There was a loud crack, and a thud.
( 186 ) They found him out cold on the floor.|Afterward he always maintained that he'd hit his head on the doorway.|Which was odd, because he wasn't very tall and there had always been plenty of room before, but he was certain that whatever happened had nothing to do with the blur of movement from the forge's darkest corner.
( 187 ) Somehow the events set the seal on the day.|It became a broken crockery day, a day of people getting under each other's feet and being peevish.|Esk's mother dropped a jug that had belonged to her grandmother and a whole box of apples in the loft turned out to be moldy.|In the forge the furnace went sullen and refused to draw.|Jaims, the oldest son, slipped on the packed ice in the road and hurt his arm.|The white cat, or possibly one of its descendants, since the cats led a private and complicated life of their own in the hayloft next to the forge, went and climbed up the chimney in the scullery and refused to come down.|Even the sky pressed in like an old mattress, and the air felt stuffy, despite the snow.
( 188 ) Frayed nerves and boredom and bad temper made the air hum like thunderstorm weather.
( 189 ) "Right!|That's it.|That's just about enough!"|shouted Esk's mother.|"Cern, you and Gulta and Esk can go and see how Granny is and-where's Esk?"

( 196 ) They found Esk sitting in a fork of the big apple tree.|The boys didn't like the tree much.|For one thing, it was so covered in mistletoe that it looked green even in midwinter, its fruit was small and went from stomach-twisting sourness to wasp-filled rottenness overnight, and although it looked easy enough to climb it had a habit of breaking twigs and dislodging feet at inconvenient moments.|Cern once swore that a branch had twisted just to spill him off.|But it tolerated Esk, who used to go and sit in it if she was annoyed or fed up or just wanted to be by herself, and the boys sensed that every brother's right to gently torture his sister ended at the foot of its trunk.|So they threw a snowball at her.|It missed.

( 204 ) They had a basket containing smoked sausages, preserved eggs and-because their mother was prudent as well as generous-a large jar of peach preserve that no one in the family liked very much.|She still made it every year when the little wild peaches were ripe, anyway.
( 205 ) The people of Bad Ass had learned to live with the long winter snows and the roads out of the village were lined with boards to reduce drifting and, more important, stop travelers from straying.|If they lived locally it wouldn't matter too much if they did, because an unsung genius on the village council several generations previously had come up with the idea of carving markers in every tenth tree in the forest around the village, out to a distance of nearly two miles.|It had taken ages, and re-cutting markers was always a job for any man with spare time, but in winters where a blizzard could lose a man within yards of his home many a life had been saved by the pattern of notches found by probing fingers under the clinging snow.
( 206 ) It was snowing again when they left the road and started up the track where, in summer, the witch's house nestled in a riot of raspberry thickets and weird witch-growth.

( 228 ) The witch's cottage consisted of so many extensions and lean-tos that it was difficult to see what the original building had looked like, or even if there had ever been one.|In the summer it was surrounded by dense beds of what Granny loosely called "the Herbs"-strange plants, hairy or squat or twining, with curious flowers or vivid fruits or unpleasantly bulging pods.|Only Granny knew what they were all for, and any wood-pigeon hungry enough to attack them generally emerged giggling to itself and bumping into things (or, sometimes, never emerged at all).

( 234 ) The cottage radiated emptiness.|They could feel it.|The windows did look like eyes, black and menacing against the snow.|And no one in the Ramtops let their fire go out in the winter, as a matter of pride.
( 235 ) Esk wanted to say "Let's go home," but she knew that if she did the boys would run for it.|Instead she said, "Mother says there's a key on a nail in the privy," and that was nearly as bad.|Even an ordinary unknown privy held minor terrors like wasps" nests, large spiders, mysterious rustling things in the roof and, one very bad winter, a small hibernating bear that caused acute constipation in the family until it was persuaded to bed down in the haybarn.|A witch's privy could contain anything.

( 238 ) In fact, when she managed to get the door open against the piled snow, it was neat and clean and contained nothing more sinister than an old almanack, or more precisely about half an old almanack, carefully hung on a nail.|Granny had a philosophical objection to reading, but she'd be the last to say that books, especially books with nice thin pages, didn't have their uses.
( 239 ) The key shared a ledge by the door with a chrysalis and the stump of a candle.|Esk took it gingerly, trying not to disturb the chrysalis, and hurried back to the boys.
( 240 ) It was no use trying the front door.|Front doors in Bad Ass were used only by brides and corpses, and Granny had always avoided becoming either.|Around the back the snow was piled in front of the door and no one had broken the ice on the water butt.
( 241 ) The light was starting to pour out of the sky by the time they dug through to the door and managed to persuade the key to turn.
( 242 ) Inside, the big kitchen was dark and chilly and smelled only of snow.|It was always dark, but they were used to seeing a big fire in the wide chimney and smelling the thick fumes of whatever it was she was boiling up this time, which sometimes gave you a headache or made you see things.
( 243 ) They wandered around uncertainly, calling, until Esk decided they couldn't put off going upstairs any longer.|The clonk of the thumb-latch on the door to the cramped staircase sounded a lot louder than it ought to.
( 244 ) Granny was on the bed, with her arms tightly folded across her chest.|The tiny window had blown open.|Fine snow had blown in across the floor and over the bed.
( 245 ) Esk stared at the patchwork quilt under the old woman, because there were times when a little detail could expand and fill the whole world.|She barely heard Cern start to cry: she remembered her father, strangely enough, making the quilt two winters before when the snow was almost as bad and there wasn't much to do in the forge, and how he'd used all kinds of rags that had found their way to Bad Ass from every part of the world, like silk, dilemma leather, water cotton and tharga wool and, of course, since he wasn't much good at sewing either, the result was a rather strange lumpy thing more like a flat tortoise than a quilt, and her mother had generously decided to give it to Granny last Hogswatchnight, and...

( 258 ) They clattered down the dark stairs.|Esk saw them out of the house and bolted the door behind them.
( 259 ) The sun was a red ball above the mountains, and there were already a few early stars out.
( 260 ) She wandered around the dark kitchen until she found a scrap of dip candle and a tinderbox.|After a great deal of effort she managed to light the candle and stood it on the table, although it didn't really light the room, it simply peopled the darkness with shadows.|Then she found Granny's rocking chair by the cold fireplace, and settled down to wait.
( 261 ) Time passed.|Nothing happened.
( 262 ) Then there was a tapping at the window.|Esk took up the candle stub and peered through the thick round panes.
( 263 ) A beady yellow eye blinked back at her.
( 264 ) The candle guttered, and went out.
( 265 ) She stood stock still, hardly breathing.|The tapping started again, and then stopped.|There was a short silence, and then the door-latch rattled.
( 266 ) Something nasty comes, the boys had said.
( 267 ) She felt her way back across the room until she nearly tripped over the rocking chair, and dragged it back and wedged it as best she could in front of the door.|The latch gave a final clonk and went silent.
( 268 ) Esk waited, listening until the silence roared in her ears.|Then something started to bang against the little window in the scullery, softly but insistently.|After a while it stopped.|A moment later it started again in the bedroom above her-a faint scrabbling noise, a claw kind of noise.
( 269 ) Esk felt that bravery was called for, but on a night like this bravery lasted only as long as a candle stayed alight.|She felt her way back across the dark kitchen, eyes tightly shut, until she reached the door.
( 270 ) There was a thump from the fireplace as a big lump of soot fell down, and when she heard the desperate scratchings coming from the chimney she slipped the bolts, threw open the door and darted out into the night.
( 271 ) The cold struck like a knife.|Frost had put a crust on the snow.|She didn't care where she was going, but quiet terror gave her a burning determination to get there as fast as she could.
( 272 ) Inside the cottage the crow landed heavily in the fireplace, surrounded by soot and muttering irritably to itself.|It hopped into the shadows, and a moment later there was the bang of the latch of the stairway door and the sound of fluttering on the stairs.
( 273 ) Esk reached up as high as she could and felt around the tree for the marker.|This time she was lucky, but the pattern of dots and grooves told her she was over a mile from the village and had been running in the wrong direction.
( 274 ) There was a cheese-rind moon and a sprinkling of stars, small and bright and pitiless.|The forest around her was a pattern of black shadows and pale snow and, she was aware, not all the shadows were standing still.
( 275 ) Everyone knew there were wolves in the mountains, because on some nights their howls echoed down from the high Tops, but they seldom came near the village-the modern wolves were the offspring of ancestors that had survived because they had learned that human meat had sharp edges.
( 276 ) But the weather was hard, and this pack was hungry enough to forget all about natural selection.
( 277 ) Esk remembered what all the children were told.|Climb a tree.|Light a fire.|When all else fails, find a stick and at least hurt them.|Never try to outrun them.
( 278 ) The tree behind her was a beech, smooth and unclimbable.
( 279 ) Esk watched a long shadow detach itself from a pool of darkness in front of her, and move a little closer.|She knelt down, tired, frightened, unable to think, and scrabbled under the burning-cold snow for a stick.
( 280 ) Granny Weatherwax opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling, which was cracked and bulged like a tent.
( 281 ) She concentrated on remembering that she had arms, not wings, and didn't need to hop.|It was always wise to lie down for a bit after a borrow, to let one's mind get used to one's body, but she knew she didn't have the time.
( 282 ) "Drat the child," she muttered, and tried to fly on to the bedrail.|The crow, who had been through all this dozens of times before and who considered, insofar as birds can consider anything, which is a very short distance indeed, that a steady diet of bacon rinds and choice kitchen scraps and a warm roost for the night was well worth the occasional inconvenience of letting Granny share its head, watched her with mild interest.

( 283 ) Granny found her boots and thumped down the stairs, sternly resisting the urge to glide.|The door was wide open and there was already a drift of fine snow on the floor.
( 284 ) "Oh, bugger," she said.|She wondered if it was worth trying to find Esk's mind, but human minds were never so sharp and clear as animal minds and anyway the overmind of the forest itself made impromptu searching as hard as listening for a waterfall in a thunderstorm.|But even without looking she could feel the packmind of the wolves, a sharp, rank feeling that filled the mouth with the taste of blood.

( 285 ) She could just make out the small footprints in the crust, half filled with fresh snow.|Cursing and muttering, Granny Weatherwax pulled her shawl around her and set out.
( 286 ) The white cat awoke from its private ledge in the forge when it heard the sounds coming from the darkest corner.|Smith had carefully shut the big doors behind him when he went off with the nearly hysterical boys, and the cat watched with interest as a thin shadow prodded at the lock and tested the hinges.
( 287 ) The doors were oak, hardened by heat and time, but that didn't prevent them being blown right across the street.
( 288 ) Smith heard a sound in the sky as he hurried along the track.|So did Granny.|It was a determined whirring sound, like the flight of geese, and the snowclouds boiled and twisted as it passed.
( 289 ) The wolves heard it, too, as it spun low over the treetops and hurtled down into the clearing.|But they heard it far too late.
( 290 ) Granny Weatherwax didn't have to follow the footprints now.|She aimed herself for the distant flashes of weird light, the strange swishing and thumping, and the howls of pain and terror.|A couple of wolves bolted past her with their ears flattened in grim determination to have it away on their paws no matter what stood in their way.
( 291 ) There was the crackle of breaking branches.|Something big and heavy landed in a fir tree by Granny and crashed, whimpering, into the snow.|Another wolf passed her in a flat trajectory at about head height and bounced off a tree-trunk.
( 292 ) There was silence.
( 293 ) Granny pushed her way between the snow-covered branches.
( 294 ) She could see that the snow was flattened in a white circle.|A few wolves lay at its edges, either dead or wisely deciding to make no move.
( 295 ) The staff stood upright in the snow and Granny got the feeling it was turning to face her as she walked carefully past it.
( 296 ) There was also a small heap in the center of the circle, curled tightly up inside itself.|Granny knelt down with some effort and reached out gently.
( 297 ) The staff moved.|It was little more than a tremble, but her hand stopped just before it touched Esk's shoulder.|Granny glared up at the wooden carvings, and dared it to move again.
( 298 ) The air thickened.|Then the staff seemed to back away while not moving, while at the same time something quite indefinable made it absolutely clear to the old witch that as far as the staff was concerned this wasn't a defeat, it was merely a tactical consideration, and it wouldn't like her to think she had won in any way, because she hadn't.
( 299 ) Esk gave a shudder.|Granny patted her vaguely.

( 302 ) Granny bit her lip.|She was never quite certain about children, thinking of them-when she thought about them at all-as coming somewhere between animals and people.|She understood babies.|You put milk in one end and kept the other end as clean as possible.|Adults were even easier, because they did the feeding and cleaning themselves.|But in between was a world of experience that she had never really inquired about.|As far as she was aware, you just tried to stop them catching anything fatal and hoped that it would all turn out all right.

( 322 ) When they had gone, with the sound of the two boys" protests ringing out among the trees, Granny opened the door, pushed Esk inside, and bolted it behind them.|She took a couple of candles from her store above the dresser and lit them.|Then she pulled some old but serviceable wool blankets, still smelling of anti-moth herbs, from an old chest, wrapped Esk in them and sat her in the rocking chair.
( 323 ) She got down on her knees, to an accompaniment of clicks and grunts, and started to lay the fire.|It was a complicated business involving dry fungus punk, wood shavings, bits of split twig and much puffing and swearing.

( 338 ) Granny rummaged in a dark wooden box on the dresser.|She prided herself on her unrivaled knowledge of the properties of Ramtops herbage-none knew better than she the many uses of Earwort, Maiden's Wish and Love-Lies-Oozing-but there were times when she had to resort to her small stock of jealously traded and carefully hoarded medicines from Forn Parts (which as far as she was concerned was anywhere farther than a day's journey) to achieve the desired effect.
( 339 ) She shredded some dry red leaves into a mug, topped it up with honey and hot water from the kettle, and pushed it into Esk's hands.|Then she put a large round stone under the grate-later on, wrapped in a scrap of blanket, it would make a bedwarmer-and, with a stern injunction to the girl not to stir from the chair, went out into the scullery.
( 340 ) Esk drummed her heels on the chair legs and sipped the drink.|It had a strange, peppery taste.|She wondered what it was.|She'd tasted Granny's brews before, of course, with a greater or lesser amount of honey in them depending on whether she thought you were making too much of a fuss, and Esk knew that she was famous throughout the mountains for special potions for illnesses that her mother-and some young women too, once in a while-just hinted at with raised eyebrows and lowered voices...
( 341 ) When Granny came back she was asleep.|She didn't remember being put to bed, or Granny bolting the windows.
( 342 ) Granny Weatherwax went back downstairs and pulled her rocking chair closer to the fire.
( 343 ) There was something there, she told herself, lurking away in the child's mind.|She didn't like to think about what it was, but she remembered what had happened to the wolves.|And all that about lighting fires with magic.|Wizards did that, it was one of the first things they learned.
( 344 ) Granny sighed.|There was only one way to be sure, and she was getting rather old for this sort of thing.
( 345 ) She picked up the candle and went out through the scullery into the lean-to that housed her goats.|They watched her without fear, each sitting in its pen like a furry blob, three mouths working rhythmically on the day's hay.|The air smelled warm and slightly flatulent.
( 346 ) Up in the rafters was a small owl, one of a number of creatures who found that living with Granny was worth the occasional inconvenience.|It came to her hand at a word, and she stroked its bullet head thoughtfully as she looked for somewhere comfortable to lie.|A pile of hay it would have to be.
( 347 ) She blew out the candle and lay back, with the owl perched on her finger.
( 348 ) The goats chewed, burped and swallowed their way through their cozy night.|They made the only sound in the building.
( 349 ) Granny's body stilled.|The owl felt her enter its mind, and graciously made room.|Granny knew she would regret this, Borrowing twice in one day would leave her good for nothing in the morning, and with a terrible desire to eat mice.|Of course, when she was younger she thought nothing of it, running with the stags, hunting with the foxes, learning the strange dark ways of the moles, hardly spending a night in her own body.|But it was getting harder now, especially coming back.|Maybe the time would come when she couldn't get back, maybe the body back home would be so much dead flesh, and maybe that wouldn't be such a bad way of it, at that.
( 350 ) This was the sort of thing wizards could never know.|If it occurred to them to enter a creature's mind they'd do it like a thief, not out of wickedness but because it simply wouldn't occur to them to do it any other way, the daft buggers.|And what good would it do to take over an owl's body?|You couldn't fly, you needed to spend a lifetime learning.|But the gentle way was to ride in its mind, steering it as gently as a breeze stirs a leaf.
( 351 ) The owl stirred, fluttered up on to the little windowsill, and glided silently into the night.
( 352 ) The clouds had cleared and the thin moon made the mountains gleam.|Granny peered out through owl eyes as she sped silently between the ranks of trees.|This was the only way to travel, once a body had the way of it!|She liked Borrowing birds best of all, using them to explore the high, hidden valleys where no one went, the secret lakes between black cliffs, the tiny walled fields on the scraps of flat ground, tucked on the sheer rock faces, that were the property of hidden and secretive beings.|Once she had ridden with the geese that passed over the mountains every spring and autumn, and had got the shock of her life when she nearly went beyond range of returning.
( 353 ) The owl broke out of the forest and skimmed across the rooftops of the village, alighting in a shower of snow on the biggest apple tree in Smith's orchard.|It was heavy with mistletoe.
( 354 ) She knew she was right as soon as her claws touched the bark.|The tree resented her, she could feel it trying to push her away.
( 355 ) I'm not going, she thought.
( 356 ) In the silence of the night the tree said, Bully me, then, just because I'm a tree.|Typical woman.
( 357 ) At least you're useful now, thought Granny.|Better a tree than a wizard, eh?
( 358 ) It's not such a bad life, thought the tree.|Sun.|Fresh air.|Time to think.|Bees, too, in the spring.
( 359 ) There was something lascivious about the way the tree said "bees" that quite put Granny, who had several hives, off the idea of honey.|It was like being reminded that eggs were unborn chickens.
TREE :	 bees

( 360 ) I've come about the girl, Esk, she hissed.
( 361 ) A promising child, thought the tree, I'm watching her with interest.|She likes apples, too.
( 362 ) You beast, said Granny, shocked.
( 363 ) What did I say?|Pardon me for not breathing, I'm sure.
( 364 ) Granny sidled closer to the trunk.
( 365 ) You must let her go, she thought.|The magic is starting to come through.
( 366 ) Already?|I'm impressed, said the tree.
( 367 ) It's the wrong sort of magic!|screeched Granny.|It's wizard magic, not women's magic!|She doesn't know what it is yet, but it killed a dozen wolves tonight!
( 368 ) Great!|said the tree.|Granny hooted with rage.
( 369 ) Great?|Supposing she had been arguing with her brothers, and lost her temper, eh?
( 370 ) The tree shrugged.|Snowflakes cascaded from its branches.
( 371 ) Then you must train her, it said.
( 372 ) Train?|What do I know from training wizards!
( 373 ) Then send her to the University.
( 374 ) She's female!|hooted Granny, bouncing up and down on her branch.
( 375 ) Well?|Who says women can't be wizards?
( 376 ) Granny hesitated.|The tree might as well have asked why fish couldn't be birds.|She drew a deep breath, and started to speak.|And stopped.|She knew a cutting, incisive, withering and above all a self-evident answer existed.|It was just that, to her extreme annoyance, she couldn't quite bring it to mind.
( 377 ) Women have never been wizards.|It's against nature.|You might as well say that witches can be men.
( 378 ) If you define a witch as one who worships the pancreative urge, that is, venerates the basic-the tree began, and continued for several minutes.|Granny Weatherwax listened in impatient annoyance to phrases like Mother Goddesses and primitive moon worship and told herself that she was well aware of what being a witch was all about, it was about herbs and curses and flying around of nights and generally keeping on the right side of tradition, and it certainly didn't involve mixing with goddesses, mothers or otherwise, who apparently got up to some very questionable tricks.|And when the tree started talking about dancing naked she tried not to listen, because although she was aware that somewhere under her complicated strata of vests and petticoats there was some skin, that didn't mean to say she approved of it.
( 379 ) The tree finished its monologue.
( 380 ) Granny waited until she was quite sure that it wasn't going to add anything, and said, That's witchcraft, is it?
( 381 ) Its theoretical basis, yes.
( 382 ) You wizards certainly get some funny ideas.
( 383 ) The tree said, Not a wizard any more, just a tree.
( 384 ) Granny ruffled her feathers.
( 385 ) Well, just you listen to me, Mr. so-called Theoretical Basis Tree, if women were meant to be wizards they'd be able to grow long white beards and she is not going to be a wizard, is that quite clear, wizardry is not the way to use magic, do you hear, it's nothing but lights and fire and meddling with power and she'll be having no part of it and good night to you.
( 386 ) The owl swooped away from the branch.|It was only because it would interfere with the flying that Granny wasn't shaking with rage.|Wizards!|They talked too much and pinned spells down in books like butterflies but, worst of all, they thought theirs was the only magic worth practicing.
( 387 ) Granny was absolutely certain of one thing.|Women had never been wizards, and they weren't about to start now.
( 388 ) She arrived back at the cottage in the pale shank of the night.|Her body, at least, was rested after its slumber in the hay, and Granny had hoped to spend a few hours in the rocking chair, putting her thoughts in order.|This was the time, when night wasn't quite over but day hadn't quite begun, when thoughts stood out bright and clear and without disguise.|She...
( 389 ) The staff was leaning against the wall, by the dresser.
( 390 ) Granny stood quite still.
( 391 ) "I see," she said at last.|"So that's the way of it, is it?|In my own house, too?"

( 392 ) Moving very slowly, she walked over to the inglenook, threw a couple of split logs on to the embers of the fire, and pumped the bellows until the flames roared up the chimney.
( 393 ) When she was satisfied she turned, muttered a few precautionary protective spells under her breath, and grabbed the staff.|It didn't resist; she nearly fell over.|But now she had it in her hands, and felt the tingle of it, the distinctive thunderstorm crackle of the magic in it, and she laughed.
( 394 ) It was as simple as this, then.|There was no fight in it now.
( 395 ) Calling down a curse upon wizards and all their works she raised the staff above her head and brought it down with a clang across the firedogs, over the hottest part of the fire.
( 396 ) Esk screamed.|The sound bounced down through the bedroom floorboards and scythed through the dark cottage.
( 397 ) Granny was old and tired and not entirely clear about things after a long day, but to survive as a witch requires an ability to jump to very large conclusions and as she stared at the staff in the flames and heard the scream her hands were already reaching for the big black kettle.|She upended it over the fire, dragged the staff out of the cloud of steam, and ran upstairs, dreading what she might see.
( 398 ) Esk was sitting up in the narrow bed, unsinged but shrieking.|Granny took the child in her arms and tried to comfort her; she wasn't sure how one went about it, but a distracted patting on the back and vague reassuring noises seemed to work, and the screams became wails and, eventually, sobs.|Here and there Granny could pick out words like "fire" and "hot," and her mouth set in a thin, bitter line.

( 399 ) Finally she settled the child down, tucked her in, and crept quietly down stairs.
( 400 ) The staff was back against the wall.|She was not surprised to see that the fire hadn't marked it at all.
( 401 ) Granny turned her rocking chair to face it, and sat down with her chin in her hand and an expression of grim determination.
( 402 ) Presently the chair began to rock, of its own accord.|It was the only sound in a silence that thickened and spread and filled the room like a terrible dark fog.
( 403 ) Next morning, before Esk got up, Granny hid the staff in the thatch, well out of harm's way.
( 404 ) Esk ate her breakfast and drank a pint of goat's milk without the least sign of the events of the last twenty-four hours.|It was the first time she had been inside Granny's cottage for more than a brief visit, and while the old woman washed the dishes and milked the goats she made the most of her implied license to explore.
( 405 ) She found that life in the cottage wasn't entirely straightforward.|There was the matter of the goats" names, for example.

( 467 ) And so, as the winter turned and started the long, reluctant climb toward spring, Esk spent days at a time with Granny Weatherwax, learning witchcraft.
( 468 ) It seemed to consist mainly of things to remember.
( 469 ) The lessons were quite practical.|There was cleaning the kitchen table and Basic Herbalism.|There was mucking out the goats and The Uses of Fungi.|There was doing the washing and The Summoning of the Small Gods.|And there was always tending the big copper still in the scullery and The Theory and Practice of Distillation.|By the time the warm Rim winds were blowing, and the snow remained only as little streaks of slush on the Hub side of trees, Esk knew how to prepare a range of ointments, several medicinal brandies, a score of special infusions, and a number of mysterious potions that Granny said she might learn the use of in good time.

( 520 ) Esk peered inside the hat.|There was some wire stiffening to give it a shape, and a couple of hatpins.|That was all.
( 521 ) There was nothing particularly strange about it, except that no one in the village had one like it.|But that didn't make it magical.|Esk bit her lip; she had a vision of herself being sent home in disgrace.
( 522 ) It didn't feel strange, and there were no hidden pockets.|It was just a typical witch's hat.|Granny always wore it when she went into the village, but in the forest she just wore a leather hood.

( 567 ) Granny Weatherwax opened her eyes and looked straight up at the sky; it was darker up here, more purple than blue.|She thought: why not?|She's a quick learner.|She knows more herblore than I do.|At her age old Gammer Tumult had me Borrowing and Shifting and Sending all the hours of the day.|Maybe I'm being too cautious.

( 575 ) Esk's face was a picture of expectation.|She looked more alive, it seemed to Granny, than she had ever been before.
( 576 ) Granny looked over the valleys stretching out before them until she found what she was after.|A gray eagle was circling lazily over a distant blue-hazed patch of forest.|Its mind was currently at ease.|It would do nicely.
( 577 ) She Called it gently, and it began to circle toward them.
( 578 ) "The first thing to remember about Borrowing is that you must be comfortable and somewhere safe," she said, smoothing out the grass behind her.|"Bed's best."

( 581 ) Esk squinted into the dark, hot sky.
( 582 ) There were...two doll figures on the grass below as she pivoted on the wind...
( 583 ) She could feel the whip and wire of the air through her feathers.|Because the eagle was not hunting, but simply enjoying the feel of the sun on its wings, the land below was a mere unimportant shape.|But the air, the air was a complex, changing three-dimensional thing, an interlocked pattern of spirals and curves that stretched away into the distance, a switchback of currents built around thermal pillars.|She...
( 584 ) ...felt a gentle pressure restraining her.
( 585 ) "The next thing to remember," said Granny's voice, very close, "is not to upset the owner.|If you let it know you're there it'll either fight you or panic, and you won't stand a chance either way.|It's had a lifetime of being an eagle, and you haven't."

( 590 ) Esk could sense Granny as a diffuse silver cloud at the back of her own mind.|After some searching she found the eagle.|She almost missed it.|Its mind was small, sharp and purple, like an arrowhead.|It was concentrating entirely on flying, and took no notice of her.
( 591 ) "Good," said Granny approvingly.|"We're not going to go far.|If you want to make it turn, you must-"

( 596 ) They floated over the mountain, while Esk excitedly explored the eagle's senses.|Granny's voice droned through her consciousness, giving instructions and guidance and warnings.|She listened with half an ear.|It sounded far too complicated.|Why couldn't she take over the eagle's mind?|It wouldn't hurt it.
( 597 ) She could see how to do it, it was just a knack, like snapping your fingers-which in fact she had never managed to achieve-and then she'd be able to experience flying for real, not at second hand.

( 606 ) The eagle beat the air over the two recumbent forms and Esk saw, in her mind's eye, two channels open for them.|Granny's mindshape vanished.
( 607 ) Now-
( 608 ) Granny had been wrong.|The eagle mind barely fought, and didn't have time to panic.|Esk held it wrapped in her own mind.|It writhed for an instant, and then melted into her.
( 609 ) Granny opened her eyes in time to see the bird give a hoarse cry of triumph, curve down low over the grass-grown scree, and skim away down the mountainside.|For a moment it was a vanishing dot and then it had gone, leaving only another echoing shriek.
( 610 ) Granny looked down at Esk's silent form.|The girl was light enough, but it was a long way home and the afternoon was dwindling.
( 611 ) "Drat," she said, with no particular emphasis.|She stood up, brushed herself down and, with a grunt of effort, hauled Esk's inert body over her shoulder.
ESK :	 Drat ,
mentioned_person ['Drat'] recent_person: it she she Esk Esk

( 612 ) High in the crystal sunset air above the mountains the eagle-Esk sought more height, drunk with the sheer vitality of flight.
( 613 ) On the way home Granny met a hungry bear.|Granny's back was giving her gyp, and she was in no mood to be growled at.|She muttered a few words under her breath and the bear, to its brief amazement, walked heavily into a tree and didn't regain consciousness for several hours.
( 614 ) When she reached the cottage Granny put Esk's body to bed and drew up the fire.|She brought the goats in and milked them, and finished the chores of the evening.
( 615 ) She made sure all the windows were open and, when it began to grow dark, lit a lantern and put it on the windowsill.
( 616 ) Granny Weatherwax didn't sleep more than a few hours a night, as a rule, and woke again at midnight.|The room hadn't changed, although the lantern had its own little solar system of very stupid moths.
( 617 ) When she woke again at dawn the candle had long burned down and Esk was still sleeping the shallow, unwakable sleep of the Borrower.
( 618 ) When she took the goats out to their paddock she looked intently at the sky.
( 619 ) Noon came, and gradually the light drained out of another day.|She paced the floor of the kitchen aimlessly.|Occasionally she would throw herself into frantic bouts of housework; ancient crusts were unceremoniously dug out of the cracks in the flagstones, and the fireback was scraped free of the winter's soot and blackleaded to within an inch of its life.|A nest of mice in the back of the dresser were kindly but firmly ejected into the goatshed.
( 620 ) Sunset came.
( 621 ) The light of the Discworld was old and slow and heavy.|From the cottage door Granny watched as it drained off the mountains, flowing in golden rivers through the forest.|Here and there it pooled in hollows until it faded and vanished.
( 622 ) She drummed her fingers sharply on the doorpost, humming a small and bitter little tune.
( 623 ) Dawn came, and the cottage was empty except for Esk's body, silent and unmoving on the bed.
( 624 ) But as the golden light flowed slowly across the Discworld like the first freshing of the tide over mudflats the eagle circled higher into the dome of heaven, beating the air down with slow and powerful wingbeats.
( 625 ) The whole of the world was spread out beneath Esk-all the continents, all the islands, all the rivers and especially the great ring of the Rim Ocean.
( 626 ) There was nothing else up here, not even sound.
( 627 ) Esk gloried in the feel of it, willing her flagging muscles into greater effort.|But something was wrong.|Her thoughts seemed to be chasing around beyond her control, and disappearing.|Pain and exhilaration and weariness poured into her mind, but it was as if other things were spilling out at the same time.|Memories dwindled away on the wind.|As fast as she could latch on to a thought it evaporated, leaving nothing behind.
( 628 ) She was losing chunks of herself, and she couldn't remember what she was losing.|She panicked, burrowing back to the things she was sure of...
( 629 ) I am Esk, and I have stolen the body of an eagle and the feel of wind in feathers, the hunger, the search of the not-sky below...
( 630 ) She tried again.|I am Esk and seeking the windpath, the pain of muscle, the cut of the air, the cold of it...
( 631 ) I am Esk high over air-damp-wet-white, above everything, the sky is thin...
( 632 ) I am I am.
( 633 ) Granny was in the garden, among the beehives, the early morning wind whipping at her skirts.|She went from hive to hive, tapping on their roofs.|Then, in the thickets of borage and beebalm that she had planted around them, she stood with her arms outstretched in front of her and sang something in tones so high that no normal person could have heard them.
( 634 ) But a roar went up from the hives, and then the air was suddenly thick with the heavy, big-eyed, deep-voiced shapes of drone bees.|They circled over her head, adding their own bass humming to her chant.
( 635 ) Then they were gone, soaring into the growing light over the clearing and streaming away over the trees.
( 636 ) It is well known-at least, it is well known to witches-that all colonies of bees are, as it were, just one part of the creature called the Swarm, in the same way that individual bees are component cells of the hivemind.|Granny didn't mingle her thoughts with the bees very often, partly because insect minds were strange, alien things that tasted of tin, but mostly because she suspected that the Swarm was a good deal more intelligent than she was.
( 637 ) She knew that the drones would soon reach the wild bee colonies in the deep forest, and within hours every corner of the mountain meadows would be under very close scrutiny indeed.|All she could do was wait.
( 638 ) At noon the drones returned, and Granny read in the sharp acid thoughts of the hivemind that there was no sign of Esk.
( 639 ) She went back into the cool of the cottage and sat down in the rocking chair, staring at the doorway.
( 640 ) She knew what the next step was.|She hated the very idea of it.|But she fetched a short ladder, climbed up creakily on to the roof, and pulled the staff from its hiding place in the thatch.
( 641 ) It was icy cold.|It steamed.
( 642 ) "Above the snowline, then," said Granny.
GRANNY WEATHERWAX :	 Above the snowline , then ,

( 643 ) She climbed down, and rammed the staff into a flowerbed.|She glared at it.|She had a nasty feeling that it was glaring back.
( 644 ) "Don't think you've won, because you haven't," she snapped.|"It's just that I haven't got the time to mess around.|You must know where she is.|I command you to take me to her!"

( 647 ) Activity, movement, liveliness-all these words would be completely inaccurate descriptions of the staff's response.
( 648 ) Granny scratched her chin.|She remembered the little lesson all children get taught: what's the magic word?
( 649 ) "Please?"|she suggested.
GRANNY :	 Please ?
mentioned_person ['Drat'] recent_person: she Granny staff Granny she

( 650 ) The staff trembled, rose a little way out of the ground, and turned in the air so that it hung invitingly at waist height.
( 651 ) Granny had heard that broomsticks were once again very much the fashion among younger witches, but she didn't hold with it.|There was no way a body could look respectable while hurtling through the air aboard a household implement.|Besides, it looked decidedly draughty.
( 652 ) But this was no time for respectability.|Pausing only to snatch her hat from its hook behind the door she scrambled up on to the staff and perched as best she could, sidesaddle of course, and with her skirts firmly gripped between her knees.
( 653 ) "Right," she said.|"Now wha-aaaaaaaaa-"

( 654 ) Across the forest animals broke and scattered as the shadow passed overhead, crying and cursing.|Granny clung on with whitened knuckles, her thin legs kicking wildly as, high above the treetops, she learned important lessons about centers of gravity and air turbulence.|The staff shot onward, heedless of her yells.
( 655 ) By the time it had come out over the upland meadows she had come to terms with it somewhat, which meant that she could just about hang on with knees and hands provided she didn't mind being upside down.|Her hat, at least, was useful, being aerodynamically shaped.
( 656 ) The staff plunged between black cliffs and along high bare valleys where, it was said, rivers of ice had once flowed in the days of the Ice Giants.|The air became thin and sharp in the throat.
( 657 ) They came to an abrupt halt over a snowdrift.|Granny fell off, and lay panting in the snow while she tried to remember why she was going through all this.
( 658 ) There was a bundle of feathers under an overhang a few feet away.|As Granny approached it a head rose jerkily, and the eagle glared at her with fierce, frightened eyes.|It tried to fly, and toppled over.|When she reached out to touch it, it took a neat triangle of flesh out of her hand.
( 659 ) "I see," said Granny quietly, to no one in particular.|She looked around, and found a boulder of about the right size.|She disappeared behind it for a few seconds, for the sake of respectability, and reappeared with a petticoat in her hand.|The bird thrashed around, ruining several weeks of meticulous petit-point embroidery, but she managed to bundle it up and hold it so that she could avoid its sporadic lunges.

( 660 ) Granny turned to the staff, which was now upright in the snowdrift.
( 661 ) "I shall walk back," she told it coldly.

( 662 ) It turned out that they were in a spur valley overlooking a drop of several hundred feet on to sharp black rocks.
( 663 ) "Very well, then," she conceded, "but you're to fly slowly, d'you understand?|And no going high."
IT :	 Very well , then , but you 're to fly slowly , d'you understand ? And no going high .
mentioned_person ['Drat'] recent_person: it she Granny it she

( 664 ) In fact, because she was slightly more experienced and perhaps because the staff was taking more care, too, the ride back was almost sedate.|Granny was almost persuaded that, given time, she could come to merely dislike flying, instead of loathing it.|What it needed was some way of stopping yourself from having to look at the ground.
( 665 ) The eagle sprawled on the rag rug in front of the empty hearth.|It had drunk some water, over which Granny had mumbled a few of the charms she normally said to impress patients, but you never knew, there might be some power in them, and it had also gulped a few strips of raw meat.
( 666 ) What it had not done was display the least sign of intelligence.
( 667 ) She wondered whether she had the right bird.|She risked another pecking and stared hard into its evil orange eyes, and tried to convince herself that way down in their depths, almost beyond sight, was a strange little flicker.
( 668 ) She probed around inside its head.|The eagle mind was still there right enough, vivid and sharp, but there was something else.|Mind, of course, has no color, but nevertheless the strands of the eagle's mind seemed to be purple.|Around them and tangled among them were faint strands of silver.
( 669 ) Esk had learned too late that mind shapes body, that Borrowing is one thing but that the dream of truly taking on another form had its built-in penalty.
( 670 ) Granny sat and rocked.|She was at a loss, she knew that.|Unraveling the tangled minds was beyond her power, beyond any power in the Ramtops, beyond even-
( 671 ) There was no sound, but maybe there was a change in the texture of the air.|She looked up at the staff, which had been suffered to come back into the cottage.
( 672 ) "No," she said firmly.
RAMTOPS :	 No ,
mentioned_person ['Drat'] recent_person: one Granny she Ramtops she

( 673 ) Then she thought: whose benefit did I say that for?|Mine?|There's power there, but it's not my kind of power.
( 674 ) There isn't any other kind around, though.|And even now I may be too late.
( 675 ) I might never have been early enough.
( 676 ) She reached out again into the bird's head to calm its fears and dispel its panic.|It allowed her to pick it up and sat awkwardly on her wrist, its talons gripping tight enough to draw blood.
( 677 ) Granny took the staff and made her way upstairs, to where Esk lay on the narrow bed in the low bedroom with its ancient contoured ceiling.
( 678 ) She made the bird perch on the bedrail and turned her attention to the staff.|Once more the carvings shifted under her glare, never quite revealing their true form.
( 679 ) Granny was no stranger to the uses of power, but she knew she relied on gentle pressure subtly to steer the tide of things.|She didn't put it like that, of course-she would have said that there was always a lever if you knew where to look.|The power in the staff was harsh, fierce, the raw stuff of magic distilled out of the forces that powered the universe itself.
( 680 ) There would be a price.|And Granny knew enough about wizardry to be certain that it would be a high one.|But if you were worried about the price, then why were you in the shop?
( 681 ) She cleared her throat, and wondered what the hell she was supposed to do next.|Perhaps if she-
( 682 ) The power hit her like a halfbrick.|She could feel it take her and lift her so that she was amazed to look down and see her feet still firmly on the floorboards.|She tried to take a step forward and magical discharges crackled in the air around her.|She reached out to steady herself against the wall and the ancient wooden beam under her hand stirred and started to sprout leaves.|A cyclone of magic swirled around the room, picking up dust and briefly giving it some very disturbing shapes; the jug and basin on the washstand, with the particularly fetching rosebud pattern, broke into fragments.|Under the bed the third member of the traditional china trio turned into something horrible and slunk away.
( 683 ) Granny opened her mouth to swear and thought better of it when her words blossomed out into rainbow-edged clouds.
( 684 ) She looked down at Esk and the eagle, which seemed oblivious to all this, and tried to concentrate.|She let herself slide inside its head and again she could see the strands of mind, the silver threads bound so closely around the purple that they took on the same shape.|But now she could see where the strands ended, and where a judicious tug or push would begin to unravel them.|It was so obvious she heard herself laugh, and the sound curved away in shades of orange and red and vanished into the ceiling.
( 685 ) Time passed.|Even with the power throbbing through her head it was a painfully hard task, like threading a needle by moonlight, but eventually she had a handful of silver.|In the slow, heavy world in which she now appeared to be she took the hank and threw it slowly toward Esk.|It became a cloud, swirled like a whirlpool, and vanished.
( 686 ) She was aware of a shrill chittering noise, and shadows on the edge of sight.|Well, it happened to everyone sooner or later.|They had come, drawn as always by a discharge of magic.|You just had to learn to ignore them.
( 687 ) Granny woke with bright sunlight skewering into her eyes.|She was slumped against the door, and her whole body felt as though it had toothache.
( 688 ) She reached out blindly with one hand, found the edge of the washstand, and pulled herself into a sitting position.|She was not really surprised to see that the jug and basin looked just the same as they had always done; in fact sheer curiosity overcame her aches and she gave a quick glance under the bed to check that, yes, things were as normal.
( 689 ) The eagle was still hunched on the bedpost.|In the bed Esk was asleep, and Granny saw that it was a true sleep and not the stillness of a vacant body.
( 690 ) All she had to do now was hope that Esk wouldn't wake up with an irresistible urge to pounce on rabbits.
( 691 ) She carried the unresisting bird downstairs and let it free outside the back door.|It flew heavily up into the nearest tree, where it settled to rest.|It had a feeling it ought to have a grudge against somebody, but for the life of it, it couldn't remember why.
( 692 ) Esk opened her eyes and stared for a long time at the ceiling.|Over the months she had grown familiar with every lump and crack of the plaster, which created a fantastic upside-down landscape that she had peopled with a private and complex civilization.
( 693 ) Her mind thronged with dreams.|She pulled an arm out from under the sheets and stared at it, wondering why it wasn't covered with feathers.|It was all very puzzling.
( 694 ) She pushed the covers back, swung her legs to the edge of the bed, spread her wings into the rush of the wind and glided out into the world...
( 695 ) The thump on the bedroom floor brought Granny scurrying up the stairs, to take her in her arms and hold her tight as the terror hit her.|She rocked back and forth on her heels, making meaningless soothing noises.
( 696 ) Esk looked up at her through a mask of horror.

( 734 ) In fact the presentation of a staff to an apprentice wizard is usually a very impressive ceremony, especially if the staff has been inherited from an elder mage; by ancient lore there is a long and frightening ordeal involving masks and hoods and swords and fearful oaths about people's tongues being cut out and their entrails torn by wild birds and their ashes scattered to the eight winds and so on.|After some hours of this sort of thing the apprentice can be admitted to the brotherhood of the Wise and Enlightened.
( 735 ) There is also a long speech.|By sheer coincidence Granny got the essence of it in a nutshell.

( 771 ) With a scream Esk spun around.|Fire flared from her fingertips and arced across the room.|The kindling exploded with a force that hurled the furniture around the room and a ball of fierce green light spluttered on the hearth.
( 772 ) Changing patterns sped across it as it spun sizzling on the stones, which cracked and then flowed.|The iron fireback resisted bravely for a few seconds before melting like wax; it made a final appearance as a red smear across the fireball and then vanished.|A moment later the kettle went the same way.
( 773 ) Just when it seemed that the chimney would follow them the ancient hearthstone gave up, and with a final splutter the fireball sank from view.
( 774 ) The occasional crackle or puff of steam signaled its passage through the earth.|Apart from that there was silence, the loud hissing silence that comes after an ear-splattering noise, and after the actinic glare the room seemed pitch dark.
( 775 ) Eventually Granny crawled out from behind the table and crept as closely as she dared to the hole, which was still surrounded by a crust of lava.|She jerked back as another cloud of superheated steam mushroomed up.
( 776 ) "They say there's dwarf mines under the Ramtops," she said inconsequentially.|"My, but them little buggers is in for a surprise."

( 792 ) That night, long after Esk had been sent to bed, Granny put on her hat, lit a fresh candle, cleared the table, and pulled a small wooden box from its secret hiding place in the dresser.|It contained a bottle of ink, an elderly quill pen, and a few sheets of paper.
( 793 ) Granny was not entirely happy when faced with the world of letters.|Her eyes protruded, her tongue stuck out, small beads of sweat formed on her forehead, but the pen scratched its way across the page to the accompaniment of the occasional quiet "drat" or "bugger the thing."

( 801 ) Their first call was to the stonemason, to order a replacement hearthstone.|Then they called on the smith.
( 802 ) It was a long and stormy meeting.|Esk wandered out into the orchard and climbed up to her old place in the apple tree while from the house came her father's shouts, her mother's wails and long silent pauses which meant that Granny Weatherwax was speaking softly in what Esk thought of as her "just so" voice.|The old woman had a flat, measured way of speaking sometimes.|It was the kind of voice the Creator had probably used.|Whether there was magic in it, or just headology, it ruled out any possibility of argument.|It made it clear that whatever it was talking about was exactly how things should be.

( 804 ) She thought about wizards.|They didn't often come to Bad Ass, but there were a fair number of stories about them.|They were wise, she recalled, and usually very old and they did powerful, complex and mysterious magics and almost all of them had beards.|They were also, without exception, men.
( 805 ) She was on firmer ground with witches, because she'd trailed off with Granny to visit a couple of villages" witches farther along the hills, and anyway witches figured largely in Ramtop folklore.|Witches were cunning, she recalled, and usually very old, or at least they tried to look old, and they did slightly suspicious, homely and organic magics and some of them had beards.|They were also, without exception, women.
( 806 ) There was some fundamental problem in all that which she couldn't quite resolve.|Why wouldn't...
( 807 ) Cern and Gulta hurtled down the path and came to a pushing, shoving halt under the tree.|They peered up at their sister with a mixture of fascination and scorn.|Witches and wizards were objects of awe, but sisters weren't.|Somehow, knowing your own sister was learning to be a witch sort of devalued the whole profession.

( 860 ) And so it was that, a week later, Granny locked the cottage door and hung the key on its nail in the privy.|The goats had been sent to stay with a sister witch further along the hills, who had also promised to keep an Eye on the cottage.|Bad Ass would just have to manage without a witch for a while.
( 861 ) Granny was vaguely aware that you didn't find the Unseen University unless it wanted you to, and the only place to start looking was the town of Ohulan Cutash, a sprawl of a hundred or so houses about fifteen miles away.|It was where you went to once or twice a year if you were a really cosmopolitan Bad Assian: Granny had only been once before in her entire life and hadn't approved of it at all.|It had smelt all wrong, she'd got lost, and she distrusted city folk with their flashy ways.
( 862 ) They got a lift on the cart that came out periodically with metal for the smithy.|It was gritty, but better than walking, especially since Granny had packed their few possessions in a large sack.|She sat on it for safety.
( 863 ) Esk sat cradling the staff and watching the woods go by.|When they were several miles outside the village she said, "I thought you told me plants were different in forn parts."

GRANNY :	 Nothing like as good ,
mentioned_person ['Unseen', 'University'] recent_person: Esk she she Granny she

( 868 ) In fact she was already feeling slightly panicky.|Her promise to accompany Esk to Unseen University had been made without thinking, and Granny, who picked up what little she knew of the rest of the Disc from rumor and the pages of her Almanack, was convinced that they were heading into earthquakes, tidal waves, plagues and massacres, many of them diuerse or even worse.|But she was determined to see it through.|A witch relied too much on words ever to go back on them.
( 869 ) She was wearing serviceable black, and concealed about her person were a number of hatpins and a breadknife.|She had hidden their small store of money, grudgingly advanced by Smith, in the mysterious strata of her underwear.|Her skirt pockets jingled with lucky charms, and a freshly forged horseshoe, always a potent preventative in time of trouble, weighed down her handbag.|She felt about as ready as she ever would be to face the world.
( 870 ) The track wound down between the mountains.|For once the sky was clear, the high Ramtops standing out crisp and white like the brides of the sky (with their trousseaux stuffed with thunderstorms) and the many little streams that bordered or crossed the path flowed sluggishly through strands of meadowsweet and go-faster-root.
( 871 ) By lunchtime they reached the suburb of Ohulan (it was too small to have more than one, which was just an inn and a handful of cottages belonging to people who couldn't stand the pressures of urban life) and a few minutes later the cart deposited them in the town's main, indeed its only, square.
( 872 ) It turned out to be market day.
( 873 ) Granny Weatherwax stood uncertainly on the cobbles, holding tightly to Esk's shoulder as the crowd swirled around them.|She had heard that lewd things could happen to country women who were freshly arrived in big cities, and she gripped her handbag until her knuckles whitened.|If any male stranger had happened to so much as nod at her it would have gone very hard indeed for him.
( 874 ) Esk's eyes were sparkling.|The square was a jigsaw of noise and color and smell.|On one side of it were the temples of the Disc's more demanding deities, and weird perfumes drifted out to join with the reeks of commerce in a complex ragrug of fragrances.|There were stalls filled with enticing curiosities that she itched to investigate.
( 875 ) Granny let the both of them drift with the crowd.|The stalls were puzzling her as well.|She peered among them, although never for one minute relaxing her vigilance against pickpockets, earthquakes and traffickers in the erotic, until she spied something vaguely familiar.
( 876 ) There was a small covered stall, black draped and musty, that had been wedged into a narrow space between two houses.|Inconspicuous though it was, it nevertheless seemed to be doing a very busy trade.|Its customers were mainly women, of all ages, although she did notice a few men.|They all had one thing in common, though.|No one approached it directly.|They all sort of strolled almost past it, then suddenly ducked under its shady canopy.|A moment later and they would be back again, hand just darting away from bag or pocket, competing for the world's Most Nonchalant Walk title so effectively that a watcher might actually doubt what he or she had just seen.
( 877 ) It was quite amazing that a stall so many people didn't know was there should be quite so popular.
( 878 ) "What's in there?"|said Esk.|"What's everyone buying?"

( 881 ) Inside, the stall was a mass of velvet shadows and the herbal scent was thick enough to bottle.|Granny poked a few bundles of dry leaves with an expert finger.|Esk pulled away from her and tried to read the scrawled labels on the bottles in front of her.|She was expert at most of Granny's preparations, but she didn't recognize anything here.|The names were quite amusing, like Tiger Oil, Maiden's Prayer and Husband's Helper, and one or two of the stoppers smelled like Granny's scullery after she had done some of her secret distillations.
( 882 ) A shape moved in the stall's dim recesses and a brown wrinkled hand slid lightly on to hers.
( 883 ) "Can I assist you, missy?"|said a cracked voice, in tones of syrup of figs, "Is it your fortune you want telling, or is it your future you want changing, maybe?"

( 896 ) They sat on bales of unknown herbs in the private corner made by the stall between the angled walls of the houses, and drank something fragrant and green out of surprisingly delicate cups.|Unlike Granny, who dressed like a very respectable raven, Hilta Goatfounder was all lace and shawls and colors and earrings and so many bangles that a mere movement of her arms sounded like a percussion section falling off a cliff.|But Esk could see the likeness.

( 935 ) Ohulan was the market town for a wide sprawling countryside and the market day didn't end at sunset.|Instead, torches flared at every booth and stall and light blared forth from the open doorways of the inns.|Even the temples put out colored lamps to attract nocturnal worshippers.
( 936 ) Hilta moved through the crowd like a slim snake through dry grass, her entire stall and stock reduced to a surprisingly small bundle on her back, and her jewelry rattling like a sackful of flamenco dancers.|Granny stumped along behind her, her feet aching from the unaccustomed prodding of the cobbles.
( 937 ) And Esk got lost.
( 938 ) It took some effort, but she managed it.|It involved ducking between two stalls and then scurrying down a side alley.|Granny had warned her at length about the unspeakable things that lurked in cities, which showed that the old woman was lacking in a complete understanding of headology, since Esk was now determined to see one or two of them for herself.
( 939 ) In fact, since Ohulan was quite barbaric and uncivilized the only things that went on after dark to any degree were a little thievery, some amateurish trading in the courts of lust, and drinking until you fell over or started singing or both.
( 940 ) According to the standard poetic instructions one should move through a fair like the white swan at evening moves o'er the bay, but because of certain practical difficulties Esk settled for moving through the crowds like a small dodgem car, bumping from body to body with the tip of the staff waving a yard above her head.|It caused some heads to turn, and not only because it had hit them; wizards occasionally passed through the town and it was the first time anyone had seen one four feet tall with long hair.
( 941 ) Anyone watching closely would have noticed strange things happening as she passed by.
( 942 ) There was, for example, the man with three upturned cups who was inviting a small crowd to explore with him the exciting world of chance and probability as it related to the position of a small dried pea.|He was vaguely aware of a small figure watching him solemnly for a few moments, and then a sackful of peas cascaded out of every cup he picked up.|Within seconds he was knee-deep in legumes.|He was a lot deeper in trouble-he suddenly owed everyone a lot of money.
( 943 ) There was a small and wretched monkey that for years had shuffled vaguely at the end of a chain while its owner played something dreadful on a pipe-organ.|It suddenly turned, narrowed its little red eyes, bit its keeper sharply in the leg, snapped its chain and had it away over the rooftops with the night's takings in a tin cup.|History is silent about what they were spent on.
( 944 ) A boxful of marzipan ducks on a nearby stall came to life and whirred past the stallholder to land, quacking happily, in the river (where, by dawn, they had all melted: that's natural selection for you).
( 945 ) The stall itself sidled off down an alley and was never seen again.
( 946 ) Esk, in fact, moved through the fair more like an arsonist moves through a hayfield or a neutron bounces through a reactor, poets notwithstanding, and the hypothetical watcher could have detected her random passage by tracing the outbreaks of hysteria and violence.|But, like all good catalysts, she wasn't actually involved in the processes she initiated, and by the time all the non-hypothetical potential watchers took their eyes off them she had been buffeted somewhere else.
( 947 ) She was also beginning to tire.|While Granny Weatherwax approved of night on general principles, she certainly didn't hold with promiscuous candlelight-if she had any reading to do after dark she generally persuaded the owl to come and sit on the back of her chair, and read through its eyes.|So Esk expected to go to bed around sunset, and that was long past.
( 948 ) There was a doorway ahead of her that looked friendly.|Cheerful sounds were sliding out on the yellow light, and pooling on the cobbles.|With the staff still radiating random magic like a demon lighthouse she headed for it, weary but determined.
( 949 ) The landlord of The Fiddler's Riddle considered himself to be a man of the world, and this was right, because he was too stupid to be really cruel, and too lazy to be really mean and although his body had been around quite a lot his mind had never gone further than the inside of his own head.
( 950 ) He wasn't used to being addressed by sticks.|Especially when they spoke in a small piping voice, and asked for goat's milk.
( 951 ) Cautiously, aware that everyone in the inn was looking at him and grinning, he pulled himself across the bar top until he could see down.|Esk stared up at him.|Look 'em right in the eye, Granny had always said: focus your power on 'em, stare 'em out, no one can outstare a witch, "cept a goat, of course.

( 958 ) Skiller eased himself back across the bar, partly to avoid the gaze, which was causing his eyes to water in sympathy, and partly because a horrible suspicion was congealing in his mind.
( 959 ) Even second-rate barmen tend to resonate with the beer they serve, and the vibrations coming from the big barrels behind him no longer had the twang of hop and head.|They were broadcasting an altogether more lactic note.
( 960 ) He turned a tap experimentally, and watched a thin stream of milk curdle in the drip bucket.
( 961 ) The staff still poked up over the edge of the counter, like a periscope.|He could swear that it was staring at him too.
( 962 ) "Don't waste it," said a voice.|"You'll be grateful for it one day."
VOICE :	 Do n't waste it , You 'll be grateful for it one day .

( 963 ) It was the same tone of voice Granny used when Esk was less than enthusiastic about a plateful of nourishing sallet greens, boiled yellow until the last few vitamins gave in, but to Skiller's hypersensitive ears it wasn't an injunction but a prediction.|He shivered.|He didn't know where he would have to be to make him grateful for a drink of ancient beer and curdled milk.|He'd rather be dead first.
( 964 ) Perhaps he would be dead first.
( 965 ) He very carefully wiped a nearly clean mug with his thumb and filled it from the tap.|He was aware that a large number of his guests were quietly leaving.|No one liked magic, especially in the hands of a woman.|You never could tell what they might take it into their heads to do next.
( 966 ) "Your milk," he said, adding, "Miss."
WOMAN :	 Your milk , Miss .

( 967 ) "I've got some money," Esk said.|Granny had always told her: always be ready to pay and you won't have to, people always like you to feel good about them, it's all headology.

( 968 ) "No, wouldn't dream of it," said Skiller hastily.|He leaned over the bar.|"If you could see, er, your way clear to turning the rest back, though?|Not much call for milk in these parts."

( 969 ) He sidled along a little way.|Esk had leaned the staff against the bar while she drank her milk, and it was making him uncomfortable.
( 970 ) Esk looked at him over a mustache of cream.
( 971 ) "I didn't turn it into milk, I just knew it would be milk because I wanted milk," she said.|"What did you think it was?"
ESK :	 I did n't turn it into milk , I just knew it would be milk because I wanted milk , What did you think it was ?

( 972 ) "Er.|Beer."

( 973 ) Esk thought about this.|She vaguely remembered trying beer once, and it had tasted sort of secondhand.|But she could recall something which everyone in Bad Ass reckoned was much better than beer.|It was one of Granny's most guarded recipes.|It was good for you, because there was only fruit in it, plus lots of freezing and boiling and careful testing of little drops with a lighted flame.
( 974 ) Granny would put a very small spoonful in her milk if it was a really cold night.|It had to be a wooden spoon, on account of what it did to metal.
( 975 ) She concentrated.|She could picture the taste in her mind, and with the little skills that she was beginning to accept but couldn't understand she found she could take the taste apart into little colored shapes...
( 976 ) Skiller's thin wife came out of their back room to see why it had all gone so quiet, and he waved her into shocked silence as Esk stood swaying very slightly with her eyes closed and her lips moving.
( 977 ) ...little shapes that you didn't need went back into the great pool of shapes, and then you found the extra ones you needed and put them together, and then there was a sort of hook thing which meant that they would turn anything suitable into something just like them, and then...
( 978 ) Skiller turned very carefully and regarded the barrel behind him.|The smell of the room had changed, he could feel the pure gold sweating gently out of that ancient woodwork.
( 979 ) With some care he took a small glass from his store under the counter and let a few splashes of the dark golden liquid escape from the tap.|He looked at it thoughtfully in the lamplight, turned the glass around methodically, sniffed it a few times, and tossed its contents back in one swallow.
( 980 ) His face remained unchanged, although his eyes went moist and his throat wobbled somewhat.|His wife and Esk watched him as a thin beading of sweat broke out on his forehead.|Ten seconds passed, and he was obviously out to break some heroic record.|There may have been steam curling out of his ears, but that could have been a rumor.|His fingers drummed a strange tattoo on the bartop.
( 981 ) At last he swallowed, appeared to reach a decision, turned solemnly to Esk, and said, "Hwarl, ish gnish saaarghs ishghs oorgsh?"
ESK :	 Hwarl , ish gnish saaarghs ishghs oorgsh ?

( 982 ) His brow wrinkled as he ran the sentence past his mind again and made a second attempt.

( 986 ) His wife snorted and took the glass out of his unprotesting hand.|She sniffed it.|She looked at the barrels, all ten of them.|She met his unsteady eye.|In a private paradise for two they soundlessly calculated the selling price of six hundred gallons of triple-distilled white mountain peach brandy and ran out of numbers.
( 987 ) Mrs. Skiller was quicker on the uptake than her husband.|She bent down and smiled at Esk, who was too tired to squint back.|It wasn't a particularly good smile, because Mrs. Skiller didn't get much practice.
( 988 ) "How did you get here, little girl?"|she said, in a voice that suggested gingerbread cottages and the slamming of big stove doors.

( 993 ) Esk looked at her gratefully, even while vaguely realizing that the woman had a face just like an eager ferret, and nodded.
( 994 ) You're right.|It's going to take more than a passing wood-chopper to sort this out.
( 995 ) Granny, meanwhile, was two streets away.|She was also, by the standards of other people, lost.|She would not see it like that.|She knew where she was, it was just that everywhere else didn't.
( 996 ) It has already been mentioned that it is much harder to detect a human mind than, say, the mind of a fox.|The human mind, seeing this as some kind of a slur, wants to know why.|This is why.
( 997 ) Animal minds are simple, and therefore sharp.|Animals never spend time dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits they've missed.|The whole panoply of the universe has been neatly expressed to them as things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, and (d) rocks.|This frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives it a cutting edge where it matters.|Your normal animal, in fact, never tries to walk and chew gum at the same time.
( 998 ) The average human, on the other hand, thinks about all sorts of things around the clock, on all sorts of levels, with interruptions from dozens of biological calendars and time-pieces.|There's thoughts about to be said, and private thoughts, and real thoughts, and thoughts about thoughts, and a whole gamut of subconscious thoughts.|To a telepath the human head is a din.|It is a railway terminus with all the Tannoys talking at once.|It is a complete FM waveband-and some of those stations aren't reputable, they're outlawed pirates on forbidden seas who play late-night records with limbic lyrics.
( 999 ) Granny, trying to locate Esk by mind magic alone, was trying to find a straw in a haystack.
( 1000 ) She was not succeeding, but enough blips of sense reached her through the heterodyne wails of a thousand brains all thinking at once to convince her that the world was, indeed, as silly as she had always believed it was.
( 1001 ) She met Hilta at the corner of the street.|She was carrying her broomstick, the better to conduct an aerial search (with great stealth, however; the men of Ohulan were right behind Stay Long Ointment but drew the line at flying women).|She was distraught.

( 1019 ) Hilta gave her a mystified look, then climbed on her broom and rose slowly and erratically into the shadows among the chimneys.|If broomsticks were cars, this one would be a split-window Morris Minor.
( 1020 ) Granny watched her go, then stumped along the wet streets after her.|She was determined that they wouldn't get her up in one of those things.
( 1021 ) Esk lay in the big, fluffy and slightly damp sheets of the spare bed in the attic room of the Riddle.|She was tired, but couldn't sleep.|The bed was too chilly, for one thing.|She wondered uneasily if she dared try to warm it up, but thought better of it.|She couldn't seem to get the hang of fire spells, no matter how carefully she experimented.|They either didn't work at all or worked only too well.|The woods around the cottage were becoming treacherous with the holes left by disappearing fireballs; at least, if the wizardry thing didn't work then Granny said she'd have a fine future as a privy builder or well sinker.
( 1022 ) She turned over and tried to ignore the bed's faint smell of mushrooms.|Then she reached out in the darkness until her hand found the staff, propped against the bedhead.|Mrs. Skiller had been quite insistent about taking it downstairs, but Esk had hung on like grim death.|It was the only thing in the world she was absolutely certain belonged to her.
( 1023 ) The varnished surface with its strange carvings felt oddly comforting.|Esk went to sleep, and dreamed bangles, and strange packages, and mountains.|And distant stars above the mountains, and a cold desert where strange creatures lurched across the dry sand and stared at her through insect eyes...
( 1024 ) There was a creak on the stairs.|Then another.|Then a silence, the sort of choking, furry silence made by someone standing as still as possible.
( 1025 ) The door swung open.|Skiller made a blacker shadow against the candlelight on the stairs, and there was a faintly whispered conversation before he tiptoed as silently as he could toward the bedhead.|The staff slipped sideways as his first cautious grope dislodged it, but he caught it quickly and let his breath out very slowly.
( 1026 ) So he hardly had enough left to scream with when the staff moved in his hands.|He felt the scaliness, the coil and muscle of it...
( 1027 ) Esk sat bolt upright in time to see Skiller roll backward down the steep stairladder, still flailing desperately at something quite invisible that coiled around his arms.|There was another scream from below as he landed on his wife.
( 1028 ) The staff clattered to the floor and lay surrounded by a faint octarine glow.
( 1029 ) Esk got out of the bed and padded across the floor.|There was a terrible cursing; it sounded unhealthy.|She peered around the door and looked down on the face of Mrs. Skiller.
( 1030 ) "Give me that staff!"
MRS. :	 Give me that staff !

( 1033 ) "It belongs to me," said Esk, and quietly closed the door.|She listened for a moment to the muttering from below and tried to think of what to do next.|Turning the couple into something would probably only cause a fuss and, anyway, she wasn't quite certain how to do it.
ESK :	 It belongs to me ,
mentioned_person ['Come'] recent_person: Esk Esk something she it

( 1034 ) The fact was the magic only really worked when she wasn't thinking about it.|Her mind seemed to get in the way.
( 1035 ) She padded across the room and pushed open the tiny window.|The strange nighttime smells of civilization drifted in-the damp smell of streets, the fragrance of garden flowers, the distant hint of an overloaded privy.|There were wet tiles outside.
( 1036 ) As Skiller started back up the stairs she pushed the staff out on to the roof and crawled after it, steadying herself on the carvings above the window.|The roof dipped down to an outhouse and she managed to stay at least vaguely upright as she half-slid, half-scrambled down the uneven tiles.|A six-foot drop on to a stack of old barrels, a quick scramble down the slippery wood, and she was trotting easily across the inn yard.
( 1037 ) As she kicked up the street mists she could hear the sounds of argument coming from the Riddle.
( 1038 ) Skiller rushed past his wife and laid a hand on the tap of the nearest barrel.|He paused, and then wrenched it open.
( 1039 ) The smell of peach brandy filled the room, sharp as knives.|He shut off the flow and relaxed.
( 1040 ) "Afraid it would turn into something nasty?"|asked his wife.|He nodded.

( 1049 ) He followed her reluctantly out of the darkened barroom.|It seemed to him that perhaps wizards didn't have such a bad life, at that.
( 1050 ) He was proved right when the following morning revealed that the ten barrels of peach brandy had, indeed, turned into something nasty.
( 1051 ) Esk wandered aimlessly through the gray streets until she reached Ohulan's tiny river docks.|Broad flat-bottomed barges bobbed gently against the wharves, and one or two of them curled wisps of smoke from friendly stovepipes.|Esk clambered easily on to the nearest, and used the staff to lever up the oilcloth that covered most of it.
( 1052 ) A warm smell, a mixture of lanolin and midden, drifted up.|The barge was laden with wool.
( 1053 ) It's silly to go to sleep on an unknown barge, not knowing what strange cliffs may be drifting past when you awake, not knowing that bargees traditionally get an early start (setting out before the sun is barely up), not knowing what new horizons might greet one on the morrow...
( 1054 ) You know that.|Esk didn't.
( 1055 ) Esk awoke to the sound of someone whistling.|She lay quite still, reeling the evening's events across her mind until she remembered why she was here, and then rolled over very carefully and raised the oilcloth a fraction.
( 1056 ) Here she was, then.|But "here" had moved.

( 1058 ) It didn't occur to her to start worrying.|For the first eight years of her life the world had been a particularly boring place and now that it was becoming interesting Esk wasn't about to act ungrateful.
( 1059 ) The distant whistler was joined by a barking dog.|Esk lay back in the wool and reached out until she found the animal's mind, and Borrowed it gently.|From its inefficient and disorganized brain she learned that there were at least four people on this barge, and many more on the others that were strung out in line with it on the river.|Some of them seemed to be children.
( 1060 ) She let the animal go and looked out at the scenery again for a long time-the barge was passing between high orange cliffs now, banded with so many colors of rock it looked as though some hungry god had made the all-time-record club sandwich-and tried to avoid the next thought.|But it persisted, arriving in her mind like the unexpected limbo dancer under the lavatory door of Life.|Sooner or later she would have to go out.|It wasn't her stomach that was pressing the point, but her bladder brooked no delay.
( 1061 ) Perhaps if she-
( 1062 ) The oilcloth over her head was pulled aside swiftly and a big bearded head beamed down at her.
( 1063 ) "Well, well," it said.|"What have we here, then?|A stowaway, yesno?"

( 1070 ) Esk stood on the deck of the barge and looked around.|The sky was bluer than a biscuit barrel, fitting neatly over a broad valley through which the river ran as sluggishly as a planning inquiry.
( 1071 ) Behind her the Ramtops still acted as a hitching rail for clouds, but they no longer dominated as they had done for as long as Esk had known them.|Distance had eroded them.

( 1092 ) Hilta's lodgings were over an herbalist's and behind a tannery, and offered splendid views of the rooftops of Ohulan.|She liked it because it offered privacy, always appreciated by, as she put it, "my more discerning clients who prefer to make their very special purchases in an atmosphere of calm where discretion is forever the watchword."

( 1110 ) This was what she saw.
( 1111 ) The viewpoint was very high up and a wide swathe of country lay below her, blue with distance, through which a broad river wriggled like a drunken snake.|There were silver lights floating in the foreground but they were, in a manner of speaking, just a few flakes in the great storm of lights that turned in a great lazy spiral, like a geriatric tornado with a bad attack of snow, and funneled down, down to the hazy landscape.|By screwing up her eyes Granny could just make out some dots on the river.
( 1112 ) Occasionally some sort of lightning would sparkle briefly inside the gently turning funnel of motes.

( 1134 ) His name was Amschat B'hal Zoon.|He lived on the raft with his three wives and three children.|He was a Liar.
( 1135 ) What always annoyed the enemies of the Zoon tribe was not simply their honesty, which was infuriatingly absolute, but their total directness of approach.|The Zoons had never heard about a euphemism, and wouldn't understand what to do with it if they had one, except that they would certainly have called it "a nice way of saying something nasty."

( 1136 ) Their rigid adherence to the truth was apparently not enjoined on them by a god, as is usually the case, but appeared to have a genetic base.|The average Zoon could no more tell a lie than breathe underwater and, in fact, the very concept was enough to upset them considerably; telling a Lie meant no less than totally altering the universe.
( 1137 ) This was something of a drawback to a trading race and so, over the millennia, the elders of the Zoon studied this strange power that everyone else had in such abundance and decided that they should possess it too.
( 1138 ) Young men who showed faint signs of having such a talent were encouraged, on special ceremonial occasions, to bend the Truth ever further on a competitive basis.|The first recorded Zoon proto-lie was: "Actually my grandfather is quite tall," but eventually they got the hang of it and the office of tribal Liar was instituted.

( 1139 ) It must be understood that while the majority of Zoon cannot lie they have great respect for any Zoon who can say that the world is other than it is, and the Liar holds a position of considerable eminence.|He represents his tribe in all his dealings with the outside world, which the average Zoon long ago gave up trying to understand.|Zoon tribes are very proud of their Liars.
( 1140 ) Other races get very annoyed about all this.|They feel that the Zoon ought to have adopted more suitable titles, like "diplomat" or "public relations officer."|They feel they are poking fun at the whole thing.

( 1162 ) And so Esk, with the minimum of difficulty and only a little regret, left the Ramtops and their weather and joined the Zoons on their great trading journey down the Ankh.
( 1163 ) There were at least thirty barges with at least one sprawling Zoon family on each, and no two vessels appeared to be carrying the same cargo; most of them were strung together, and the Zoons simply hauled on the cable and stepped on to the next deck if they fancied a bit of socializing.
( 1164 ) Esk set up home in the fleeces.|It was warm, smelled slightly of Granny's cottage and, much more important, meant that she was undisturbed.
( 1165 ) She was getting a bit worried about magic.
( 1166 ) It was definitely getting out of control.|She wasn't doing magic, it was just happening around her.|And she sensed that people probably wouldn't be too happy if they knew.
( 1167 ) It meant that if she washed up she had to clatter and splash at length to conceal the fact that the dishes were cleaning themselves.|If she did some darning she had to do it on some private part of the deck to conceal the fact that the edges of the hole raveled themselves together as if...as if by magic.|Then she woke up on the second day of her voyage to find that several of the fleeces around the spot where she had hidden the staff had combed, carded and spun themselves into neat skeins during the night.
( 1168 ) She put all thoughts of lighting fires out of her head.
( 1169 ) There were compensations, though.|Every sluggish turn of the great brown river brought new scenes.|There were dark stretches hemmed in with deep forest, through which the barges traveled in the dead center of the river with the men armed and the women below-except for Esk, who sat listening with interest to the snortings and sneezings that followed them through the bushes on the banks.|There were stretches of farmland.|There were several towns much larger than Ohulan.|There were even some mountains, although they were old and flat and not young and frisky like her mountains.|Not that she was homesick, exactly, but sometimes she felt like a boat herself, drifting on the edge of an infinite rope but always attached to an anchor.
( 1170 ) The barges stopped at some of the towns.|By tradition only the men went ashore, and only Amschat, wearing his ceremonial Lying hat, spoke to non-Zoons.|Esk usually went with him.|He tried hinting that she should obey the unwritten rules of Zoon life and stay afloat, but a hint was to Esk what a mosquito bite was to the average rhino because she was already learning that if you ignore the rules people will, half the time, quietly rewrite them so that they don't apply to you.
( 1171 ) Anyway, it seemed to Amschat that when Esk was with him he always got a very good price.|There was something about a small child squinting determinedly at them from behind his legs that made even market-hardened merchants hastily conclude their business.
( 1172 ) In fact, it began to worry him.|When a market broker in the walled town of Zemphis offered him a bag of ultramarines in exchange for a hundred fleeces a voice from the level of his pockets said: "They're not ultramarines."
POCKETS :	 They 're not ultramarines .

( 1176 ) Amschat turned the stone over in his palm.|Putting the chameleon spircle stones into a box with some real gems so that they appeared to change their hue was a traditional trick, but these had the true inner blue fire.|He looked up sharply at the broker.|Amschat had been finely trained in the art of the Lie.|He recognized the subtle signs, now that he came to think about it.
( 1177 ) "There seems to be a doubt," he said, "but "tis easily resolved, we need only take them to the assayer in Pine Street because the world knows that spircles will dissolve in hypactic fluid, yesno?"

( 1178 ) The broker hesitated.|Amschat had changed position slightly, and the set of his muscles suggested that any sudden movement on the broker's part would see him flat in the dust.|And that damn child was squinting at him as though she could see through to the back of his mind.|His nerve broke.
( 1179 ) "I regret this unfortunate dispute," he said.|"I had accepted the stones as ultramarines in good faith but rather than cause disharmony between us I will ask you to accept them as-as a gift, and for the fleeces may I offer this roseatte of the first sorting?"

( 1180 ) He took a small red stone from a tiny velvet pouch.|Amschat hardly looked at it but, without taking his eyes off the man, passed it down to Esk.|She nodded.
( 1181 ) When the merchant had hurried off Amschat took Esk's hand and half-dragged her to the assayer's stall, which was little more than a niche in the wall.|The old man took the smallest of the blue stones, listened to Amschat's hurried explanation, poured out a saucerful of hypactic fluid and dropped the stone in.|It frothed into nothingness.

( 1190 ) The assayer grumbled a bit at this, but at last they settled on three zats and one of the spircles on a thin silver chain for Esk.
( 1191 ) When they were out of earshot Amschat handed her the tiny silver coins and said: "These are yours.|You have earned them.|But-" he hunkered down so that his eyes were on a level with hers, "-you must tell me how you knew the stones were false."

( 1198 ) She gave a philosophical sigh and set about exploring the possibilities of the town.
( 1199 ) There was the question of the staff, though.|Esk had rammed it deep among the fleeces, which were not going to be unloaded yet.|If she went back for it people would start asking questions, and she didn't know the answers.
( 1200 ) She found a convenient alleyway and scuttled down it until a deep doorway gave her the privacy she required.
( 1201 ) If going back was out of the question then only one thing remained.|She held out a hand and closed her eyes.
( 1202 ) She knew exactly what she wanted to do-it lay in front of her eyes.|The staff mustn't come flying through the air, wrecking the barge and drawing attention to itself.|All she wanted, she told herself, was for there to be a slight change in the way the world was organized.|It shouldn't be a world where the staff was in the fleeces, it should be a world where it was in her hand.|A tiny change, an infinitesimal alteration to the Way Things Were.
( 1203 ) If Esk had been properly trained in wizardry she would have known that this was impossible.|All wizards knew how to move things about, starting with protons and working upward, but the important thing about moving something from A to Z, according to basic physics, was that at some point it should pass through the rest of the alphabet.|The only way one could cause something to vanish at A and appear at Z would be to shuffle the whole of Reality sideways.|The problems this would cause didn't bear thinking about.
( 1204 ) Esk, of course, had not been trained, and it is well known that a vital ingredient of success is not knowing that what you're attempting can't be done.|A person ignorant of the possibility of failure can be a halfbrick in the path of the bicycle of history.
( 1205 ) As Esk tried to work out how to move the staff the ripples spread out in the magical ether, changing the Discworld in thousands of tiny ways.|Most went entirely unnoticed.|Perhaps a few grains of sand lay on their beaches in a slightly different position, or the occasional leaf hung on its tree in a marginally different way.|But then the wavefront of probability struck the edge of Reality and rebounded like the slosh off the side of the pond which, meeting the laggard ripples coming the other way, caused small but important whirlpools in the very fabric of existence.|You can have whirlpools in the fabric of existence, because it is a very strange fabric.
( 1206 ) Esk was completely ignorant of all this, of course, but was quite satisfied when the staff dropped out of thin air into her hand.
( 1207 ) It felt warm.
( 1208 ) She looked at it for some time.|She felt that she ought to do something about it; it was too big, too distinctive, too inconvenient.|It attracted attention.
( 1209 ) "If I'm taking you to Ankh-Morpork," she said thoughtfully, "You've got to go in disguise."
SOMETHING :	 If I 'm taking you to Ankh-Morpork , You 've got to go in disguise .
mentioned_person ['Ankh-Morpork'] recent_person: she something it she she

( 1210 ) A few late flickers of magic played around the staff, and then it went dark.
( 1211 ) Eventually Esk solved the immediate problem by finding a stall in the main Zemphis marketplace that sold broomsticks, buying the largest, carrying it back to her doorway, removing the handle and ramming the staff deep into the birch twigs.|It didn't seem right to treat a noble object in this way, and she silently apologized to it.
( 1212 ) It made a difference, anyway.|No one looked twice at a small girl carrying a broom.
( 1213 ) She bought a spice pasty to eat while exploring (the stallholder carelessly shortchanged her, and only realized later that he had inexplicably handed over two silver pieces; also, rats mysteriously got in and ate all his stock during the night, and his grandmother was struck by lightning).
( 1214 ) The town was smaller than Ohulan, and very different because it lay on the junction of three trade routes quite apart from the river itself.|It was built around one enormous square which was a cross between a permanent exotic traffic jam and a tent village.|Camels kicked mules, mules kicked horses, horses kicked camels and they all kicked humans; there was a riot of colors, a din of noise, a nasal orchestration of smells and the steady, heady sound of hundreds of people working hard at making money.
( 1215 ) One reason for the bustle was that over large parts of the continent other people preferred to make money without working at all, and since the Disc had yet to develop a music recording industry they were forced to fall back on older, more traditional forms of banditry.
( 1216 ) Strangely enough these often involved considerable effort.|Rolling heavy rocks to the top of cliffs for a decent ambush, cutting down trees to block the road, and digging a pit lined with spikes while still keeping a wicked edge on a dagger probably involved a much greater expenditure of thought and muscle than more socially acceptable professions but, nevertheless, there were still people misguided enough to endure all this, plus long nights in uncomfortable surroundings, merely to get their hands on perfectly ordinary large boxes of jewels.
( 1217 ) So a town like Zemphis was the place where caravans split, mingled and came together again, as dozens of merchants and travelers banded together for protection against the socially disadvantaged on the trails ahead.|Esk, wandering unregarded amidst the bustle, learned all this by the simple method of finding someone who looked important and tugging on the hem of his coat.
( 1218 ) This particular man was counting bales of tobacco and would have succeeded but for the interruption.
( 1219 ) "What?"

( 1241 ) "You mean tobacco threadworm?"|He looked wild-eyed at the stack of bales being unloaded by, now he came to think about it, a vendor with the nervous look of a midnight sprite who wants to get away before you find out what fairy gold turns into in the morning.|"But he told me these had been well stored and-how do you know, anyway?"

( 1242 ) The child had disappeared among the crowds.|The merchant looked hard at the spot where she had been.|He looked hard at the vendor, who was grinning nervously.|He looked hard at the sky.|Then took his sampling knife out of his pocket, stared at it for a moment, appeared to reach a decision, and sidled toward the nearest bale.
( 1243 ) Esk, meanwhile, had by random eavesdropping found the caravan being assembled for Ankh-Morpork.|The trail boss was sitting at a table made up of a plank across two barrels.
( 1244 ) He was busy.
( 1245 ) He was talking to a wizard.
( 1246 ) Seasoned travelers know that a party setting out to cross possibly hostile country should have a fair number of swords in it but should definitely have a wizard in case there is any need for magic arts and, even if these do not become necessary, for lighting fires.|A wizard of the third rank or above does not expect to pay for the privilege of joining the party.|Rather, he expects to be paid.|Delicate negotiations were even now coming to a conclusion.
( 1247 ) "Fair enough, Master Treatle, but what of the young man?"|said the trail boss, one Adab Gander, an impressive figure in a trollhide jerkin, rakishly floppy hat and a leather kilt.|"He's no wizard, I can see."

( 1252 ) All he needs to get right to the top, he thought, is a bit of a handicap.|Wizards are martyrs to things like asthma and flat feet, it somehow seems to give them their drive.

( 1290 ) Granny Weatherwax was in trouble.
( 1291 ) First of all, she decided, she should never have allowed Hilta to talk her into borrowing her broomstick.|It was elderly, erratic, would fly only at night and even then couldn't manage a speed much above a trot.
( 1292 ) Its lifting spells had worn so thin that it wouldn't even begin to operate until it was already moving at a fair lick.|It was, in fact, the only broomstick ever to need bump-starting.
( 1293 ) And it was while Granny Weatherwax, sweating and cursing, was running along a forest path holding the damn thing at shoulder height for the tenth time that she had found the bear trap.
( 1294 ) The second problem was that a bear had found it first.|In fact this hadn't been too much of a problem because Granny, already in a bad temper, hit it right between the eyes with the broomstick and it was now sitting as far away from her as it was possible to get in a pit, and trying to think happy thoughts.

( 1317 ) The dwarf halls rang to the sound of hammers, although mainly for effect.|Dwarves found it hard to think without the sound of hammers, which they found soothing, so well-off dwarves in the clerical professions paid goblins to hit small ceremonial anvils, just to maintain the correct dwarvish image.

( 1335 ) Gander the trail boss was a worried man.
( 1336 ) They were three mornings out from Zemphis, making good time, and were climbing now toward the rocky pass through the mountains known as the Paps of Scilla (there were eight of them; Gander often wondered who Scilla had been, and whether he would have liked her).
( 1337 ) A party of gnolls had crept up on them during the night.|The nasty creatures, a variety of stone goblin, had slit the throat of a guard and must have been poised to slaughter the entire party.|Only...
( 1338 ) Only no one knew quite what had happened next.|The screams had woken them up, and by the time people had puffed up the fires and Treatle the wizard had cast a blue radiance over the campsite the surviving gnolls were distant, spidery shadows, running as if all the legions of Hell were after them.
( 1339 ) Judging by what had happened to their colleagues, they were probably right.|Bits of gnolls hung from the nearby rocks, giving them a sort of jolly, festive air.|Gander wasn't particularly sorry about that-gnolls liked to capture travelers and practice hospitality of the red-hot-knife-and-bludgeon kind-but he was nervous of being in the same area as Something that went through a dozen wiry and wickedly armed gnolls like a spoon through a lightly boiled egg but left no tracks.
( 1340 ) In fact the ground was swept clean.
( 1341 ) It had been a very long night, and the morning didn't seem to be an improvement.|The only person more than half-awake was Esk, who had slept through the whole thing under one of the wagons and had complained only of odd dreams.
( 1342 ) Still, it was a relief to get away from that macabre sight.|Gander considered that gnolls didn't look any better inside than out.|He hated their guts.
( 1343 ) Esk sat on Treatle's wagon, talking to Simon who was steering inexpertly while the wizard caught up with some sleep behind them.
( 1344 ) Simon did everything inexpertly.|He was really good at it.|He was one of those tall lads apparently made out of knees, thumbs and elbows.|Watching him walk was a strain, you kept waiting for the strings to snap, and when he talked the spasm of agony on his face if he spotted an S or W looming ahead in the sentence made people instinctively say them for him.|It was worth it for the grateful look which spread across his acned face like sunrise on the moon.

( 1430 ) The whole caravan was traveling only a little faster than walking pace.|Esk jumped down, pulled the staff from its temporary hiding place among the bags and pails on the side of the wagon, and ran back along the line of carts and animals.|Through her tears she caught a glimpse of Simon peering from the back of the wagon, an open book in his hands.|He gave her a puzzled smile and started to say something, but she ran on and veered off the track.
( 1431 ) Scrubby whinbushes scratched her legs as she scrambled up a clay bank and then she was running free across a barren plateau, hemmed in by the orange cliffs.
( 1432 ) She didn't stop until she was good and lost but the anger still burned brightly.|She had been angry before, but never like this; normally anger was like the red flame you got when the forge was first lit, all glow and sparks, but this anger was different-it had the bellows behind it, and had narrowed to the tiny blue-white flame that cuts iron.
( 1433 ) It made her body tingle.|She had to do something about it or burst.
( 1434 ) Why was it that when she heard Granny ramble on about witchcraft she longed for the cutting magic of wizardry, but whenever she heard Treatle speak in his high-pitched voice she would fight to the death for witchcraft?|She'd be both, or none at all.|And the more they intended to stop her, the more she wanted it.
( 1435 ) She'd be a witch and a wizard too.|And she would show them.
( 1436 ) Esk sat down under a low-spreading juniper bush at the foot of a steep, sheer cliff, her mind seething with plans and anger.|She could sense doors being slammed before she had barely begun to open them.|Treatle was right; they wouldn't let her inside the University.|Having a staff wasn't enough to be a wizard, there had to be training too, and no one was going to train her.
( 1437 ) The midday sun beat down off the cliff and the air around Esk began to smell of bees and gin.|She lay back, looking at the near-purple dome of the sky through the leaves and, eventually, she fell asleep.
( 1438 ) One side effect of using magic is that one tends to have realistic and disturbing dreams.|There is a reason for this, but even thinking about it is enough to give a wizard nightmares.
( 1439 ) The fact is that the minds of wizards can give thoughts a shape.|Witches normally work with what actually exists in the world, but a wizard can, if he's good enough, put flesh on his imagination.|This wouldn't cause any trouble if it wasn't for the fact that the little circle of candlelight loosely called "the universe of time and space" is adrift in something much more unpleasant and unpredictable.|Strange Things circle and grunt outside the flimsy stockades of normality; there are weird hootings and howlings in the deep crevices at the edge of Time.|There are things so horrible that even the dark is afraid of them.
TIME :	 the universe of time and space
mentioned_person ['Are'] recent_person: it something Things Time things

( 1440 ) Most people don't know this and this is just as well because the world could not really operate if everyone stayed in bed with the blankets over their head, which is what would happen if people knew what horrors lay a shadow's width away.
( 1441 ) The problem is people interested in magic and mysticism spend a lot of time loitering on the very edge of the light, as it were, which gets them noticed by the creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions who then try to use them in their indefatigable efforts to break into this particular Reality.
( 1442 ) Most people can resist this, but the relentless probing by the Things is never stronger than when the subject is asleep.
( 1443 ) Bel-Shamharoth, C'hulagen, the Insider-the hideous old dark gods of the Necrotelicomnicon, the book known to certain mad adepts by its true name of Liber Paginarum Fulvarum, are always ready to steal into a slumbering mind.|The nightmares are often colorful and always unpleasant.
( 1444 ) Esk had got used to them ever since that first dream after her first Borrowing, and familiarity had almost replaced terror.|When she found herself sitting on a glittering, dusty plain under unexplained stars she knew it was time for another one.
( 1445 ) "Drat," she said.|"All right, come on then.|Bring on the monsters.|I just hope it isn't the one with his winkle on his face."

( 1446 ) But this time it seemed that the nightmare had changed.|Esk looked around and saw, rearing up behind her, a tall black castle.|Its turrets disappeared among the stars.|Lights and fireworks and interesting music cascaded from its upper battlements.|The huge double doors stood invitingly open.|There seemed to be quite an amusing party going on in there.
( 1447 ) She stood up, brushed the silver sand off her dress, and set off for the gates.
( 1448 ) She had almost reached them when they slammed.|They didn't appear to move; it was simply that in one instant they were lounging ajar, and the next they were tight shut with a clang that shook the horizons.
( 1449 ) Esk reached out and touched them.|They were black, and so cold that ice was beginning to form on them.
( 1450 ) There was a movement behind her.|She turned around and saw the staff, without its broomstick disguise, standing upright in the sand.|Little worms of light crept around its polished wood and crept around the carvings no one could ever quite identify.
( 1451 ) She picked it up and smashed it against the doors.|There was a shower of octarine sparks, but the black metal was unscathed.
( 1452 ) Esk's eyes narrowed.|She held the staff at arm's length and concentrated until a thin line of fire leapt from the wood and burst against the gate.|The ice flashed into steam but the darkness-she was sure now that it wasn't metal-absorbed the power without so much as glowing.|She doubled the energy, letting the staff put all its stored magic into a beam that was now so bright that she had to shut her eyes (and could still see it as a brilliant line in her mind).
( 1453 ) Then it winked out.
( 1454 ) After a few seconds Esk ran forward and touched the doors gingerly.|The coldness nearly froze her fingers off.
( 1455 ) And from the battlements above she could hear the sound of sniggering.|Laughter wouldn't have been so bad, especially an impressive demonic laugh with lots of echo, but this was just-sniggering.
( 1456 ) It went on for a long time.|It was one of the most unpleasant sounds Esk had ever heard.
( 1457 ) She woke up shivering.|It was long after midnight and the stars looked damp and chilly; the air was full of the busy silence of the night, which is created by hundreds of small furry things treading very carefully in the hope of finding dinner while avoiding being the main course.
( 1458 ) A crescent moon was setting and a thin gray glow toward the rim of the world suggested that, against all probability, another day was on the cards.
( 1459 ) Someone had wrapped Esk in a blanket.

( 1494 ) We will pass over the running up and down, the tightening of the broomstick's bindings, the muttered curses against dwarves, the brief moments of hope as the magic flickered fitfully, the horrible black feelings as it died, the tightening of the bindings again, the running again, the sudden catching of the spell, the scrambling aboard, the yelling, the takeoff...
( 1495 ) Esk clung to Granny with one hand and held her staff in the other as they, frankly, pottered along a few hundred feet above the ground.|A few birds flew alongside them, interested in this new flying tree.

( 1502 ) It has already been revealed that light on the Discworld travels slowly, the result of its passage through the Disc's vast and ancient magical field.
( 1503 ) So dawn isn't the sudden affair that it is on other worlds.|The new day doesn't erupt, it sort of sloshes gently across the sleeping landscape in the same way that the tide sneaks in across the beach, melting the sandcastles of the night.|It tends to flow around mountains.|If the trees are close together it comes out of woods cut to ribbons and sliced with shadows.
( 1504 ) An observer on some suitable high point, let's say for the sake of argument a wisp of cirro-stratus on the edge of space, would remark on how lovingly the light spreads across the land, how it leaps forward on the plains and slows down when it encounters high ground, how beautifully it...
( 1505 ) Actually, there are some kinds of observers who, faced with all this beauty, will whine that you can't have heavy light and certainly wouldn't be able to see it, even if you could.|To which one can only reply, so how come you're standing on a cloud?
( 1506 ) So much for cynicism.|But down on the Disc itself the broomstick barreled forward on the cusp of dawn, dropping ever backward in the shadow of night.

( 1515 ) And they would indeed have crashed.|But she remembered in time to grab her hat and brace herself.|The broomstick gave a shudder, tilted-
( 1516 ) -and the landscape blurred.
( 1517 ) It was really quite a short trip but one that Granny knew she would always remember, generally around three o'clock in the morning after eating rich food.|She would remember the rainbow colors that hummed in the rushing air, the horrible heavy feeling, the impression that something very big and heavy was sitting on the universe.
( 1518 ) She would remember Esk's laughter.|She would remember, despite her best efforts, the way the ground sped below them, whole mountain ranges flashing past with nasty zipping noises.
( 1519 ) Most of all, she would remember catching up with the night.
( 1520 ) It appeared ahead of her, a ragged line of darkness running ahead of the remorseless morning.|She stared in horrified fascination as the line became a blot, a stain, a whole continent of blackness that raced toward them.
( 1521 ) For an instant they were poised on the crest of the dawn as it broke in silent thunder on the land.|No surfer ever rode such a wave, but the broomstick broke through the broil of light and shot smoothly through into the coolness beyond.
( 1522 ) Granny let herself breathe out.
( 1523 ) Darkness took some of the terror out of the flight.|It also meant that if Esk lost interest the broomstick ought to be able to fly under its own rather rusty magic.

( 1531 ) The broomstick slowed.|The rainbow bubble around it vanished with an audible pop.|Without a jolt, without so much as a shudder, Granny found herself flying at a respectable speed again.
( 1532 ) Granny had built a solid reputation on always knowing the answer to everything.|Getting her to admit ignorance, even to herself, was an astonishing achievement.|But the worm of curiosity was chewing at the apple of her mind.

( 1537 ) Granny stared into the night.|She had never heard of magic like that, but it sounded awfully powerful and probably lethal.|Went into the picture!|Of course, all magic changed the world in some way, wizards thought there was no other use for it-they didn't truck with the idea of leaving the world as it was and changing the people-but this sounded more literal.|It needed thinking about.|On the ground.
( 1538 ) For the first time in her life Granny wondered whether there might be something important in all these books people were setting such store by these days, although she was opposed to books on strict moral grounds, since she had heard that many of them were written by dead people and therefore it stood to reason reading them would be as bad as necromancy.|Among the many things in the infinitely varied universe with which Granny did not hold was talking to dead people, who by all accounts had enough troubles of their own.
( 1539 ) But not, she was inclined to feel, as many as she had.|She looked down bemusedly at the dark ground and wondered vaguely why the stars were below her.
( 1540 ) For a cardiac moment she wondered if they had indeed flown over the edge, and then she realized that the thousands of little pinpoints below her were too yellow, and flickered.|Besides, whoever heard of stars arranged in such a neat pattern?
( 1541 ) "It's very pretty," said Esk.|"Is it a city?"

( 1542 ) Granny scanned the ground wildly.|If it was a city, then it was too big.|But now she had time to think about it, it certainly smelled like a lot of people.
( 1543 ) The air around them reeked of incense and grain and spices and beer, but mainly of the sort of smell that was caused by a high water table, thousands of people, and a robust approach to drainage.
( 1544 ) She mentally shook herself.|The day was hard on their heels.|She looked for an area where the torches were dim and widely spaced, reasoning that this would mean a poor district and poor people did not object to witches, and gently pointed the broom handle downward.
( 1545 ) She managed to get within five feet of the ground before dawn arrived for the second time.
( 1546 ) The gates were indeed big and black and looked as if they were made out of solid darkness.
( 1547 ) Granny and Esk stood among the crowds that thronged the square outside the University and stared up at them.|Finally Esk said: "I can't see how people get in."

( 1551 ) They had been in Ankh-Morpork for three days and Granny was beginning to enjoy herself, much to her surprise.|She had found them lodgings in The Shades, an ancient part of the city whose inhabitants were largely nocturnal and never inquired about one another's business because curiosity not only killed the cat but threw it in the river with weights tied to its feet.|The lodgings were on the top floor next to the well-guarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because, as Granny had heard, good fences make good neighbors.
( 1552 ) The Shades, in brief, were an abode of discredited gods and unlicensed thieves, ladies of the night and peddlers in exotic goods, alchemists of the mind and strolling mummers; in short, all the grease on civilization's axle.
( 1553 ) And yet, despite the fact that these people tend to appreciate the soft magics, there was a remarkable shortage of witches.|Within hours the news of Granny's arrival had seeped through the quarter and a stream of people crept, sidled or strutted toward her door, seeking potions and charms and news of the future and various personal and specialized services that witches traditionally provide for those whose lives are a little clouded or full of stormy weather.
( 1554 ) She was at first annoyed, and then embarrassed, and then flattered; her clients had money, which was useful, but they also paid in respect, and that was a rock-hard currency.
( 1555 ) In short, Granny was even wondering about the possibility of acquiring slightly larger premises with a bit of garden and sending for her goats.|The smell might be a problem, but the goats would just have to put up with it.
( 1556 ) They had visited the sights of Ankh-Morpork, its crowded docks, its many bridges, its souks, its casbahs, its streets lined with nothing but temples.|Granny had counted the temples with a thoughtful look in her eyes; gods were always demanding that their followers acted other than according to their true natures, and the human fallout this caused made plenty of work for witches.
( 1557 ) The terrors of civilization had so far failed to materialize, although a cutpurse had tried to make off with Granny's handbag.|To the amazement of passersby Granny called him back, and back he came, fighting his feet which had totally ceased to obey him.|No one quite saw what happened to her eyes when she stared into his face or heard the words she whispered in his cowering ear, but he gave her back all her money plus quite a lot of money belonging to other people, and before she let him go had promised to have a shave, stand up straight, and be a better person for the rest of his life.|By nightfall Granny's description was circulated to all the chapter houses of the Guild of Thieves, Cutpurses, Housebreakers and Allied Trades*, with strict instructions to avoid her at all costs.|Thieves, being largely creatures of the night themselves, know trouble when it stares them in the face.
( 1558 ) Granny had also written two more letters to the University.|There had been no reply.

( 1613 ) Esk walked along between Treatle and Simon and drank it all in.|It wasn't just that there was magic in the air, but it was tamed and working, like a millrace.|It was power, but it was harnessed.

( 1625 ) He led the way up a broad flight of steps to an impressive pair of doors.|At least, they were designed to be impressive.|The designer had invested deeply in heavy locks, curly hinges, brass studs and an intricately carved archway to make it absolutely clear to anyone entering that they were not very important people at all.
( 1626 ) He was a wizard.|He had forgotten the doorknocker.
( 1627 ) Treatle rapped on the door with his staff.|It hesitated for a while, and then slowly slid back its bolts and swung open.
( 1628 ) The hall was full of wizards and boys.|And boys" parents.
( 1629 ) There are two ways of getting into Unseen University (in fact there are three, but at this time wizards hadn't realized it).
( 1630 ) The first is to achieve some great work of magic, such as the recovery of an ancient and powerful relic or the invention of a totally new spell, but in these times it was seldom done.|In the past there had been great wizards capable of forming whole new spells from the chaotic raw magic of the world, wizards from whom as it were all the spells of wizardry had flowed, but those days had gone; there were no more sorcerers.
( 1631 ) So the more typical method was to be sponsored by a senior and respected wizard, after a suitable period of apprenticeship.
( 1632 ) Competition was stiff for a University place and the honor and privileges an Unseen degree could bring.|Many of the boys milling around the hall, and launching minor spells at each other, would fail and have to spend their lives as lowly magicians, mere magical technologists with defiant beards and leather patches on their elbows who congregated in small jealous groups at parties.
( 1633 ) Not for them the coveted pointy hat with optional astrological symbols, or the impressive robes, or the staff of authority.|But at least they could look down on conjurers, who tended to be jolly and fat and inclined to drop their aitches and drink beer and go around with sad thin women in spangly tights and really infuriate magicians by not realizing how lowly they were and kept telling them jokes.|Lowliest of all-apart from witches, of course-were thaumaturgists, who never got any schooling at all.|A thaumaturgist could just about be trusted to wash out an alembic.|Many spells required things like mold from a corpse dead of crushing, or the semen of a living tiger, or the root of a plant that gave an ultrasonic scream when it was uprooted.|Who was sent to get them?|Right.
( 1634 ) It is a common error to refer to the lower magical ranks as hedge wizards.|In fact hedge wizardry is a very honored and specialized form of magic that attracts silent, thoughtful men of the druidical persuasion and topiaric inclinations.|If you invited a hedge wizard to a party he would spend half the evening talking to your potted plant.|And he would spend the other half listening.
( 1635 ) Esk noticed that there were some women in the hall, because even young wizards had mothers and sisters.|Whole families had turned up to bid the favored sons farewell.|There was a considerable blowing of noses, wiping of tears and the clink of coins as proud fathers tucked a little spending money into their offspring's hands.
( 1636 ) Very senior wizards were perambulating among the crowds, talking to the sponsoring wizards and examining the prospective students.
( 1637 ) Several of them pushed through the throng to meet Treatle, moving like gold-trimmed galleons under full sail.|They bowed gravely to him and looked approvingly at Simon.
( 1638 ) "This is young Simon, is it?"|said the fattest of them, beaming at the boy.|"We've heard great reports of you, young man.|Eh?|What?"

( 1658 ) For a few seconds nothing happened.|He stood with his lips moving soundlessly, and then silence spread out from him like candlelight.|Ripples of noiselessness washed across the crowds in the hall, striking the walls with all the force of a blown kiss and then curling back in waves.|People watched their companions mouthing silently and then went red with effort when their own laughter was as audible as a gnat's squeak.
( 1659 ) Tiny motes of light winked into existence around his head.|They whirled and spiraled in a complex three-dimensional dance, and then formed a shape.
( 1660 ) In fact it seemed to Esk that the shape had been there all the time, waiting for her eyes to see it, in the same way that a perfectly innocent cloud can suddenly become, without changing in any way, a whale or a ship or a face.
( 1661 ) The shape around Simon's head was the world.
( 1662 ) That was quite clear, although the glitter and rush of the little lights blurred some of the detail.|But there was Great A'Tuin the sky turtle, with the four Elephants on its back, and on them the Disc itself.|There was the sparkle of the great waterfall around the edge of the world, and there at the very hub a tiny needle of rock that was the great mountain Cori Celesti, where the gods lived.
( 1663 ) The image expanded and homed in on the Circle Sea and then on Ankh itself, the little lights flowing away from Simon and winking out of existence a few feet from his head.|Now they showed the city from the air, rushing toward the watchers.|There was the University itself, growing larger.|There was the Great Hall-
( 1664 ) -there were the people, watching silent and open-mouthed, and Simon himself, outlined in specks of silver light.|And a tiny sparkling image in the air around him, and that image contained an image and another and another-

( 1666 ) The walls faded.|So did the floor.|The paintings of former great mages, all scrolls and beards and slightly constipated frowns, vanished.|The tiles underfoot, a rather nice black and white pattern, evaporated-to be replaced by fine sand, gray as moonlight and cold as ice.|Strange and unexpected stars glittered overhead; on the horizon were low hills, eroded not by wind or rain in this weatherless place but by the soft sandpaper of Time itself.
( 1667 ) No one else seemed to have noticed.|No one else, in fact, seemed alive.|Esk was surrounded by people as still and silent as statues.
( 1668 ) And they weren't alone.|There were other-Things-behind them, and more were appearing all the time.|They had no shape, or rather they seemed to be taking their shapes at random from a variety of creatures; they gave the impression that they had heard about arms and legs and jaws and claws and organs but didn't really know how they all fitted together.|Or didn't care.|Or were so hungry they hadn't bothered to find out.
( 1669 ) They made a sound like a swarm of flies.
( 1670 ) They were the creatures out of her dreams, come to feed on magic.|She knew they weren't interested in her now, except in the nature of an after-dinner mint.|Their whole concentration was focused on Simon, who was totally unaware of their presence.
( 1671 ) Esk kicked him smartly on the ankle.
( 1672 ) The cold desert vanished.|The real world rushed back.|Simon opened his eyes, smiled faintly, and gently fell backward into Esk's arms.
( 1673 ) A buzz went up from the wizards, and several of them started to clap.|No one seemed to have noticed anything odd, apart from the silver lights.

( 1732 ) The great doors of Unseen University are made of octiron, a metal so unstable that it can only exist in a universe saturated with raw magic.|They are impregnable to all force save magic: no fire, no battering ram, no army can breach them.
( 1733 ) Which is why most ordinary visitors to the University use the back door, which is made of perfectly normal wood and doesn't go around terrorizing people, or even stand still terrorizing people.|It had a proper knocker and everything.
( 1734 ) Granny examined the doorposts carefully and gave a grunt of satisfaction when she spotted what she was looking for.|She hadn't doubted that it would be there, cunningly concealed by the natural grain of the wood.
( 1735 ) She grasped the knocker, which was shaped like a dragon's head, and rapped smartly, three times.|After a while the door was opened by a young woman with her mouth full of clothes-pegs.

( 1737 ) Granny bowed, giving the girl a chance to take in the pointy black hat with the batwing hatpins.|It had an impressive effect: she blushed and, peering out into the quiet alleyway, hurriedly motioned Granny inside.
( 1738 ) There was a big mossy courtyard on the other side of the wall, crisscrossed with washing lines.|Granny had the chance to become one of the very few women to learn what it really is that wizards wear under their robes, but modestly averted her eyes and followed the girl across the flagstones and down a wide flight of steps.
( 1739 ) They led into a long, high tunnel lined with archways and, currently, full of steam.|Granny caught sight of long lines of washtubs in the big rooms off to the sides; the air had the warm fat smell of ironing.|A gaggle of girls carrying wash-baskets pushed past her and hurried up the steps-then stopped, halfway up, and turned slowly to look at her.
( 1740 ) Granny set her shoulders back and tried to look as mysterious as possible.
( 1741 ) Her guide, who still hadn't got rid of her clothes-pegs, led her down a side-passage into a room that was a maze of shelves piled with laundry.|In the very center of the maze, sitting at a table, was a very fat woman with a ginger wig.|She had been writing in a very large laundry book-it was still open in front of her-but was currently inspecting a large stained vest.

( 1749 ) "Yes, yes, thank you, Ksandra, you may go," said the fat woman.|She stood up and beamed at Granny, and with an almost perceptible click wound her voice up several social classes.

( 1751 ) Granny looked blank, but only a fraction of a second.|The witchmarks on the doorpost had said that the housekeeper welcomed witches and was particularly anxious for news of her four husbands; she was also in random pursuit of a fifth, hence the ginger wig and, if Granny's ears weren't deceiving her, the creak of enough whalebone to infuriate an entire ecology movement.|Gullible and foolish, the signs had said.|Granny withheld judgment, because city witches didn't seem that bright themselves.
( 1752 ) The housekeeper must have mistaken her expression.
( 1753 ) "Don't be afraid," she said.|"May staff have distinct instructions to welcome witches, although of course they upstairs don't approve.|No doubt you would like a cup of tea and something to eat?"

( 1757 ) The housekeeper swept forward with a sound like an elderly tea clipper in a gale, and beckoned Granny to follow her.

( 1759 ) Granny stumped along after her.|Old clothes?|Did this fat woman really mean it?|The nerve!|Of course, if they were good quality...
( 1760 ) There seemed to be a whole world under the University.|It was a maze of cellars, coldrooms, stillrooms, kitchens and sculleries, and every inhabitant was either carrying something, pumping something, pushing something or just standing around and shouting.|Granny caught glimpses of rooms full of ice, and others glowing with the heat from red-hot cooking stoves, wall-sized.|Bakeries smelled of new bread and taprooms smelled of old beer.|Everything smelled of sweat and wood-smoke.
( 1761 ) The housekeeper led her up an old spiral staircase and unlocked the door with one of the large number of keys that hung from her belt.
( 1762 ) The room inside was pink and frilly.|There were frills on things that no one in their right mind would frill.|It was like being inside candyfloss.
( 1763 ) "Very nice," said Granny.|And, because she felt it was expected of her, "Tasteful."|She looked around for something unfrilly to sit on, and gave up.

( 1767 ) Granny had nothing against fortune-telling provided it was done badly by people with no talent for it.|It was a different matter if people who ought to know better did it, though.|She considered that the future was a frail enough thing at best, and if people looked at it hard they changed it.|Granny had some quite complex theories about space and time and why they shouldn't be tinkered with, but fortunately good fortune-tellers were rare and anyway people preferred bad fortune-tellers, who could be relied upon for the correct dose of uplift and optimism.
( 1768 ) Granny knew all about bad fortune-telling.|It was harder than the real thing.|You needed a good imagination.
( 1769 ) She couldn't help wondering if Mrs. Whitlow was a born witch who somehow missed her training.|She was certainly laying siege to the future.|There was a crystal ball under a sort of pink frilly tea cozy, and several sets of divinatory cards, and a pink velvet bag of rune stones, and one of those little tables on wheels that no prudent witch would touch with a ten-foot broomstick, and-Granny wasn't sure on this point-either some special dried monkey turds from a llamassary or some dried llama turds from a monastery, which apparently could be thrown in such a way as to reveal the sum total of knowledge and wisdom in the universe.|It was all rather sad.
( 1770 ) "Or there's the tea-leaves, of course," said Mrs. Whitlow, indicating the big brown pot on the table between them.|"Aye know witches often prefer them, but they always seem so, well, common to me.|No offense meant."
MRS. PALM :	 Or there 's the tea-leaves , of course , Aye know witches often prefer them , but they always seem so , well , common to me . No offense meant .
mentioned_person ['Aye'] recent_person: witch one Mrs. Mrs. Whitlow

( 1771 ) There probably wasn't any offense meant, at that, thought Granny.|Mrs. Whitlow was giving her the sort of look generally used by puppies when they're not sure what to expect next, and are beginning to worry that it may be the rolled-up newspaper.
( 1772 ) She picked up Mrs. Whitlow's cup and had started to peer into it when she caught the disappointed expression that floated across the housekeeper's face like a shadow across a snowfield.|Then she remembered what she was doing, and turned the cup widdershins three times, made a few vague passes over it and mumbled a charm (which she normally used to cure mastitis in elderly goats, but never mind).|This display of obvious magical talent seemed to cheer up Mrs. Whitlow no end.
( 1773 ) Granny wasn't normally very good at tea-leaves, but she squinted at the sugar-encrusted mess at the bottom of the cup and let her mind wander.|What she really needed now was a handy rat or even a cockroach that happened to be somewhere near Esk, so that she could Borrow its mind.
( 1774 ) What Granny actually found was that the University had a mind of its own.
( 1775 ) It is well known that stone can think, because the whole of electronics is based on that fact, but in some universes men spend ages looking for other intelligences in the sky without once looking under their feet.|That is because they've got the time-span all wrong.|From stone's point of view the universe is hardly created and mountain ranges are bouncing up and down like organ-stops while continents zip backward and forward in general high spirits, crashing into each other from the sheer joy of momentum and getting their rocks off.|It is going to be quite some time before stone notices its disfiguring little skin disease and starts to scratch, which is just as well.
( 1776 ) The rocks from which Unseen University was built, however, have been absorbing magic for several thousand years and all that random power has had to go somewhere.
( 1777 ) The University has, in fact, developed a personality.
( 1778 ) Granny could sense it like a big and quite friendly animal, just waiting to roll over on its roof and have its floor scratched.|It was paying no attention to her, however.|It was watching Esk.
( 1779 ) Granny found the child by following the threads of the University's attention and watched in fascination as the scenes unfolded in the Great Hall...

( 1788 ) Granny nodded, and opened her windows.|She extended her east and west wings and tried to concentrate on the tiny cup held in her pillars.
( 1789 ) Fortunately Mrs. Whitlow put her plaster complexion and stony silence down to occult powers at work, while Granny found that a brief exposure to the vast silicon memory of the University had quite stimulated her imagination.
( 1790 ) In a voice like a draughty corridor, which made the housekeeper very impressed, she wove a future full of keen young men fighting for Mrs. Whitlow's ample favors.|She also spoke very quickly, because what she had seen in the Great Hall made her anxious to go around to the main gates again.

( 1817 ) Cooks and scullery maids darted for cover as the old woman pounded along the slippery flagstones, leapt up the stairs to the courtyard and skidded out into the lane, her shawl flying out behind her and her boots striking sparks from the cobbles.|Once out into the open she hitched up her skirts and broke into a full gallop, turning the corner into the main square in a screeching two-boot drift that left a long white scratch across the stones.

( 1831 ) Another advantage of city life, Granny had discovered, was glassware.|Some of her more complicated potions required apparatus which either had to be bought from the dwarves at extortionate rates or, if ordered from the nearest human glassblower, arrived in straw and, usually, pieces.|She had tried blowing her own and the effort always made her cough, which produced some very funny results.|But the city's thriving alchemy profession meant that there were whole shops full of glass for the buying, and a witch could always arrange bargain prices.

( 1873 ) But no one looked.
( 1874 ) Esk sat at one of the high deep windows and stared out over the city.|She was feeling angrier than usual, so the broom attacked the dust with unusual vigor.|Spiders ran desperate eight-legged dashes for safety as ancestral cobwebs disappeared into the void.|In the walls mice clung to each other, legs braced against the inside of their holes.|Wood-worm scrabbled in the ceiling beams as they were drawn, inexorably, backward down their tunnels.

( 1876 ) There were some good points, she had to admit.|The food was simple but there was plenty of it, and she had a room to herself somewhere in the roof and it was quite luxurious because here she could lie in until five A.M., which to Granny's way of thinking was practically noon.|The work certainly wasn't hard.|She just started sweeping until the staff realized what was expected of it, and then she could amuse herself until it was finished.|If anyone came the staff would immediately lean itself nonchalantly against a wall.
( 1877 ) But she wasn't learning any wizardry.|She could wander into empty classrooms and look at the diagrams chalked on the board, and on the floor too in the more advanced classes, but the shapes were meaningless.|And unpleasant.
( 1878 ) They reminded Esk of the pictures in Simon's book.|They looked alive.
( 1879 ) She gazed out across the rooftops of Ankh-Morpork and reasoned like this: writing was only the words that people said, squeezed between layers of paper until they were fossilized (fossils were well known on the Discworld, great spiraled shells and badly constructed creatures that were left over from the time when the Creator hadn't really decided what He wanted to make and was, as it were, just idly messing around with the Pleistocene).|And the words people said were just shadows of real things.|But some things were too big to be really trapped in words, and even the words were too powerful to be completely tamed by writing.
( 1880 ) So it followed that some writing was actually trying to become things.|Esk's thoughts became confused things at this point, but she was certain that the really magic words were the ones that pulsed angrily, trying to escape and become real.
( 1881 ) They didn't look very nice.
( 1882 ) But then she remembered the previous day.
( 1883 ) It had been rather odd.|The University classrooms were designed on the funnel principle, with tiers of seats-polished by the bottoms of the Disc's greatest mages-looking precipitously down into a central area where there was a workbench, a couple of blackboards and enough floor space for a decent-sized instructional octogram.|There was a lot of dead space under the tiers and Esk had found it a quite useful observation post, peering around between the apprentice wizards" pointy boots at the instructor.|It was very restful, with the droning of the lecturers drifting over her as gently as the buzzing of the slightly zonked bees in Granny's special herb garden.|There never seemed to be any practical magic, it always seemed to be just words.|Wizards seemed to like words.
( 1884 ) But yesterday had been different.|Esk had been sitting in the dusty gloom, trying to do even some very simple magic, when she heard the door open and boots clump across the floor.|That was surprising in itself.|Esk knew the timetable, and the Second Year students who normally occupied this room were down for Beginners" Dematerialization with Jeophal the Spry in the gym.|(Students of magic had little use for physical exercise; the gym was a large room lined with lead and rowan wood, where neophytes could work out at High magic without seriously unbalancing the universe, although not always without seriously unbalancing themselves.|Magic had no mercy on the ham-fisted.|Some clumsy students were lucky enough to walk out, others were removed in bottles.)
( 1885 ) Esk peeped between the slats.|These weren't students, they were wizards.|Quite high ones, to judge by their robes.|And there was no mistaking the figure that climbed on to the lecturer's dais like a badly strung puppet, bumping heavily into the lectern and absentmindedly apologizing to it.|It was Simon.|No one else had eyes like two raw eggs in warm water and a nose bright red from blowing.|For Simon, the pollen count always went to infinity.
( 1886 ) It occurred to Esk that, minus his general allergy to the whole of Creation and with a decent haircut and a few lessons in deportment, the boy could look quite handsome.|It was an unusual thought, and she squirreled it away for future consideration.
( 1887 ) When the wizards had settled down, Simon began to talk.|He read from notes, and every time he stuttered over a word the wizards, as one man, without being able to stop themselves, chorused it for him.
( 1888 ) After a while a stick of chalk rose from the lectern and started to write on the blackboard behind him.|Esk had picked up enough about wizard magic to know that this was an astounding achievement-Simon had been at the University for a couple of weeks, and most students hadn't mastered Light Levitation by the end of their second year.
( 1889 ) The little white stub skittered and squeaked across the blackness to the accompaniment of Simon's voice.|Even allowing for the stutter, he was not a very good speaker.|He dropped notes.|He corrected himself.|He ummed and ahhed.|And as far as Esk was concerned he wasn't saying anything very much.|Phrases filtered down to her hiding place.|"Basic fabric of the universe" was one, and she didn't understand what that was, unless he meant denim, or maybe flannelette.|"Mutability of the possibility matrix" she couldn't guess at all.

( 1890 ) Sometimes he seemed to be saying that nothing existed unless people thought it did, and the world was really only there at all because people kept on imagining it.|But then he seemed to be saying that there was lots of worlds, all nearly the same and all sort of occupying the same place but all separated by the thickness of a shadow, so that everything that ever could happen would have somewhere to happen in.
( 1891 ) (Esk could get to grips with this.|She had half-suspected it ever since she cleaned out the senior wizards" lavatory, or rather while the staff got on with the job while Esk examined the urinals and, with the assistance of some half-remembered details of her brothers in the tin bath in front of the fire at home, formulated her unofficial General Theory of comparative anatomy.|The senior wizards" lavatory was a magical place, with real running water and interesting tiles and, most importantly, two big silver mirrors fixed to opposite walls so that someone looking into one could see themselves repeated again and again until the image was too small to see.|It was Esk's first introduction to the idea of infinity.|More to the point, she had a suspicion that one of the mirror Esks, right on the edge of sight, was waving at her.)
( 1892 ) There was something disturbing about the phrases Simon used.|Half the time he seemed to be saying that the world was about as real as a soap bubble, or a dream.
( 1893 ) The chalk shrieked its way across the board behind him.|Sometimes Simon had to stop and explain symbols to the wizards, who seemed to Esk to be getting excited at some very silly sentences.|Then the chalk would start again, curving across the darkness like a comet, trailing its dust behind it.
( 1894 ) The light was fading out of the sky outside.|As the room grew more gloomy the chalked words glowed and the blackboard appeared to Esk to be not so much dark as simply not there at all, but just a square hole cut out of the world.
( 1895 ) Simon talked on, about the world being made up of tiny things whose presence could only be determined by the fact that they were not there, little spinning balls of nothinness that magic could shunt together to make stars and butterflies and diamonds.|Everything was made up of emptiness.
( 1896 ) The funny thing was, he seemed to find this fascinating.
( 1897 ) Esk was only aware that the walls of the room grew as thin and insubstantial as smoke, as if the emptiness in them was expanding to swallow whatever it was that defined them as walls, and instead there was nothing but the familiar cold, empty, glittering plain with its distant worn hills, and the creatures that stood as still as statues, looking down.
( 1898 ) There were a lot more of them now.|They seemed for all the world to be clustering like moths around a light.
( 1899 ) One important difference was that a moth's face, even close up, was as friendly as a bunny rabbit's compared to the things watching Simon.
( 1900 ) Then a servant came in to light the lamps and the creatures vanished, turning into perfectly harmless shadows that lurked in the corners of the room.
( 1901 ) At some time in the recent past someone had decided to brighten the ancient corridors of the University by painting them, having some vague notion that Learning Should Be Fun.|It hadn't worked.|It's a fact known throughout the universes that no matter how carefully the colors are chosen, institutional decor ends up as either vomit green, unmentionable brown, nicotine yellow or surgical appliance pink.|By some little-understood process of sympathetic resonance, corridors painted in those colors always smell slightly of boiled cabbage-even if no cabbage is ever cooked in the vicinity.
( 1902 ) Somewhere in the corridors a bell rang.|Esk dropped lightly from her windowsill, grabbed the staff and started to sweep industriously as doors were flung open and the corridors filled with students.|They streamed past her on two sides, like water around a rock.|For a few minutes there was utter confusion.|Then doors slammed, a few laggard feet pattered away in the distance, and Esk was by herself again.
( 1903 ) Not for the first time, Esk wished that the staff could talk.|The other servants were friendly enough, but you couldn't talk to them.|Not about magic, anyway.
( 1904 ) She was also coming to the conclusion that she ought to learn to read.|This reading business seemed to be the key to wizard magic, which was all about words.|Wizards seemed to think that names were the same as things, and that if you changed the name, you changed the thing.|At least, it seemed to be something like that...
( 1905 ) Reading.|That meant the library.|Simon had said there were thousands of books in it, and among all those words there were bound to be one or two she could read.|Esk put the staff over her shoulder and set off resolutely for Mrs. Whitlow's office.
( 1906 ) She was nearly there when a wall said "Psst!"|When Esk stared at it it turned out to be Granny.|It wasn't that Granny could make herself invisible, it was just that she had this talent for being able to fade into the foreground so that she wasn't noticed.

( 1932 ) The orangutan reached out slowly and then snatched it with a grin of triumph.
( 1933 ) There may be universes where librarianship is considered a peaceful sort of occupation, and where the risks are limited to large volumes falling off the shelves on to one's head, but the keeper of a magic library is no job for the unwary.|Spells have power, and merely writing them down and shoving them between covers doesn't do anything to reduce it.|The stuff leaks.|Books tend to react with one another, creating randomized magic with a mind of its own.|Books of magic are usually chained to their shelves, but not to prevent them being stolen...
( 1934 ) One such accident had turned the librarian into an ape, since when he had resisted all attempts to turn him back, explaining in sign language that life as an orangutan was considerably better than life as a human being, because all the big philosophical questions resolved themselves into wondering where the next banana was coming from.|Anyway, long arms and prehensile feet were ideal for dealing with high shelves.
( 1935 ) Esk gave him the whole bunch of bananas and scurried away amongst the books before he could object.
( 1936 ) Esk had never seen more than one book at a time and so the library was, for all she knew, just like any other library.|True, it was a bit odd the way the floor seemed to become the wall in the distance, and there was something strange about the way the shelves played tricks on the eyes and seemed to twist through rather more dimensions than the normal three, and it was quite surprising to look up and see shelves on the ceiling, with the occasional student wandering unconcernedly among them.
( 1937 ) The truth was that the presence of so much magic distorted the space around it.|Down in the stacks the very denim, or possibly flannelette, of the universe was tortured into very peculiar shapes.|The millions of trapped words, unable to escape, bent reality around them.
( 1938 ) It seemed logical to Esk that among all these books should be one that told you how to read all the others.|She wasn't sure how to find it, but deep in her soul she felt it would probably have pictures of cheerful rabbits and happy kittens on the cover.
( 1939 ) The library certainly wasn't silent.|There was the occasional zip and sizzle of a magical discharge, and an octarine spark would flash from shelf to shelf.|Chains clinked, faintly.|And, of course, there was the faint rustle of thousands of pages in their leather-bound prisons.
( 1940 ) Esk made sure no one was paying her any attention and pulled at the nearest volume.|It sprang open in her hands, and she saw gloomily that there were the same unpleasant types of diagram that she had noticed in Simon's book.|The writing was entirely unfamiliar, and she was glad about that-it would be horrible to know what all those letters, which seemed to be made up of ugly creatures doing complicated things to each other, actually meant.|She forced the cover shut, even though the words seemed to be desperately pushing back.|There was a drawing of a creature on the front; it looked suspiciously like one of the things from the cold desert.|It certainly didn't look like a happy kitten.

( 1980 ) Esk caught a faint swirling in the air above his head.|For a moment she saw them, the great gray shapes from the cold place.|Watching.|And in the calm of the Library, when the weight of magic was wearing the universe particularly thin, they had decided to Act.
( 1981 ) Around her the muted rustling of the books rose to a desperate riffling of pages.|Some of the more powerful books managed to jerk out of their shelves and swung, flapping madly, from the end of their chains.|A huge grimoire plunged from its eyrie on the topmost shelf-tearing itself free of its chain in the process-and flopped away like a frightened chicken, scattering its pages behind it.

( 1987 ) Horror can steal into the mind via all the senses.|There's the sound of the little meaningful chuckle in the locked dark room, the sight of half a caterpillar in your forkful of salad, the curious smell from the lodger's bedroom, the taste of slug in the cauliflower cheese.|Touch doesn't normally get a look-in.
( 1988 ) But something happened to the floor under Esk's hands.|She looked down, her face a rictus of horror, because the dusty floorboards suddenly felt gritty.|And dry.|And very, very cold.
( 1989 ) There was fine silver sand between her fingers.
( 1990 ) She grabbed the staff and, sheltering her eyes against the wind, waved it at the towering figures above her.|It would have been nice to report that a searing flash of pure white fire cleansed the greasy air.|It failed to materialize...
( 1991 ) The staff twisted like a snake in her hand and caught Simon a crack on the side of the head.

( 1997 ) A hand like a fine leather glove slipped gently into hers and a voice behind said "Ook," very softly.|She turned, and found herself staring down into the gentle, inner-tube face of the librarian.|He put his finger to his lips in an unmistakable gesture and tugged gently at her hand.

( 2107 ) And thus it was that while the entire faculty of Unseen University were dining in the venerable hall the doors were flung back with a dramatic effect that was rather spoiled when one of them rebounded off a waiter and caught Granny a crack on the shin.|Instead of the defiant strides she had intended to make across the checkered floor she was forced to half-hop, half-limp.|But she hoped that she hopped with dignity.
( 2108 ) Esk hurried along behind her, acutely aware of the hundreds of eyes that were turned toward them.
( 2109 ) The roar of conversation and the clatter of cutlery faded away.|A couple of chairs were knocked over.|At the far end of the hall she could see the most senior wizards at their high table, which in fact bobbed a few feet off the floor.|They were staring.
( 2110 ) A medium-grade wizard-Esk recognized him as a lecturer in Applied Astrology-rushed toward them, waving his hands.

( 2117 ) Esk tapped her on the back.|A couple of wizards with a rather greater presence of mind had nipped smartly out of the door behind them, and now several college porters were advancing threateningly up the hall, to the cheers and cat-calls of the students.|Esk had never much liked the porters, who lived a private life in their lodge, but now she felt a pang of sympathy for them.
( 2118 ) Two of them reached out hairy hands and grabbed Granny's shoulders.|Her arm disappeared behind her back and there was a brief flurry of movement that ended with the men hopping away, clutching bits of themselves and swearing.
( 2119 ) "Hatpin," said Granny.|She grabbed Esk with her free hand and swept toward the high table, glaring at anyone who so much as looked as if they were going to get in her way.|The younger students, who knew free entertainment when they saw it, stamped and cheered and banged their plates on the long tables.|The high table settled on the tiles with a thump and the senior wizards hurriedly lined up behind Cutangle as he tried to summon up his reserves of dignity.|His efforts didn't really work; it is very hard to look dignified with a napkin tucked into one's collar.

( 2125 ) Cutangle stood with legs planted wide apart, arms akimbo and stomach giving an impression of a beginners" ski slope, the whole of him therefore adopting a pose usually associated with Henry VIII but with an option on Henry IX and X as well.

( 2129 ) Cutangle staggered backward, his hands raised to ward off Granny's gaze.|The wizards behind him scattered, turning over tables in their haste to avoid the stare.
( 2130 ) Granny's eyes had changed.
( 2131 ) Esk had never seen them like this before.|They were perfectly silver, like little round mirrors, reflecting all they saw.|Cutangle was a vanishingly small dot in their depths, his mouth open, his tiny matchstick arms waving in desperation.
( 2132 ) The Archchancellor backed into a pillar, and the shock made him recover.|He shook his head irritably, cupped a hand and sent a stream of white fire streaking toward the witch.
( 2133 ) Without dropping her iridescent stare Granny raised a hand and deflected the flames toward the roof.|There was an explosion and a shower of tile fragments.
( 2134 ) Her eyes widened.
( 2135 ) Cutangle vanished.|Where he had been standing a huge snake coiled, poised to strike.
( 2136 ) Granny vanished.|Where she had been standing was a large wicker basket.
( 2137 ) The snake became a giant reptile from the mists of time.
( 2138 ) The basket became the snow wind of the Ice Giants, coating the struggling monster with ice.
( 2139 ) The reptile became a saber-toothed tiger, crouched to spring.
( 2140 ) The gale became a bubbling tar pit.
( 2141 ) The tiger managed to become an eagle, stooping.
( 2142 ) The tar pits became a tufted hood.
( 2143 ) Then the images began to flicker as shape replaced shape.|Stroboscope shadows danced around the hall.|A magical wind sprang up, thick and greasy, striking octarine sparks from beards and fingers.|In the middle of it all Esk, peering through streaming eyes, could just make out the two figures of Granny and Cutangle, glossy statues in the midst of the hurtling images.
( 2144 ) She was also aware of something else, a high-pitched sound almost beyond hearing.
( 2145 ) She had heard it before, on the cold plain-a busy chittering noise, a beehive noise, an anthill sound...
( 2146 ) "They're coming!"|she screamed above the din.|"They're coming now!"

( 2147 ) She scrambled out from behind the table where she had taken refuge from the magical duel and tried to reach Granny.|A gust of raw magic lifted her off her feet and bowled her into a chair.
( 2148 ) The buzzing was louder now, so that the air roared like a three-week corpse on a summer's day.|Esk made another attempt to reach Granny and recoiled when green fire roared along her arm and singed her hair.
( 2149 ) She looked around wildly for the other wizards, but those who had fled from the effects of the magic were cowering behind overturned furniture while the occult storm raged over their heads.
( 2150 ) Esk ran down the length of the hall and out into the dark corridor.|Shadows curled around her as she hurried, sobbing, up the steps and along the buzzing corridors toward Simon's narrow room.
( 2151 ) Something would try to enter the body, Granny had said.|Something that would walk and talk like Simon, but would be something else...
( 2152 ) A cluster of students were hovering anxiously outside the door.|They turned pale faces toward Esk as she darted toward them, and were sufficiently shaken to draw back nervously in the face of her determined progress.
( 2153 ) "Something's in there," said one of them.

( 2156 ) Esk grabbed the doorhandle and turned it.|It moved slightly, but then spun back with such force it nearly took the skin off her hands.|The chittering inside rose to a crescendo and there was another noise, too, like leather flapping.
( 2157 ) "You're wizards!"|she screamed.|"Bloody well wizz!"

( 2161 ) Esk went to the door, and then stopped with one foot in the air.|She remembered Granny talking about how even buildings had a mind, if they were old enough.|The University was very old.
( 2162 ) She stepped carefully to one side and ran her hands over the ancient stones.|It had to be done carefully, so as not to frighten it-and now she could feel the mind in the stones, slow and simple, but still mind.|It pulsed around her; she could feel the little sparkles deep in the rock.
( 2163 ) Something was hooting behind the door.
( 2164 ) The three students watched in astonishment as Esk stood rock still with her hands and forehead pressed against the wall.
( 2165 ) She was almost there.|She could feel the weight of herself, the ponderousness of her body, the distant memories of the dawn of time when rock was molten and free.|For the first time in her life she knew what it was like to have balconies.
( 2166 ) She moved gently through the building-mind, refining her impressions, looking as fast as she dared for this corridor, this door.
( 2167 ) She stretched out one arm, very carefully.|The students watched as she uncurled one finger, very slowly.
( 2168 ) The door hinges began to creak.
( 2169 ) There was a moment of tension and then the nails sprang from the hinges and clattered into the wall behind her.|The planks began to bend as the door still tried to force itself open against the strength of-whatever was holding it shut.
( 2170 ) The wood billowed.
( 2171 ) Beams of blue light lanced out into the corridor, moving and dancing as indistinct shapes shuffled through the blinding brilliance inside the room.|The light was misty and actinic, the sort of light to make Steven Spielberg reach for his copyright lawyer.
( 2172 ) Esk's hair leapt from her head so that she looked like an ambulant dandelion.|Little firesnakes of magic crackled across her skin as she stepped through the doorway.
( 2173 ) The students outside watched in horror as she disappeared into the light.
( 2174 ) It vanished in a silent explosion.
( 2175 ) When they eventually found enough courage to look inside the room, they saw nothing there but the sleeping body of Simon.|And Esk, silent and cold on the floor, breathing very slowly.|And the floor was covered with a fine layer of silver sand.
( 2176 ) Esk floated through the mists of the world, noticing with a curious impersonal feeling the precise way in which she passed through solid matter.
( 2177 ) There were others with her.|She could hear their chittering.
( 2178 ) Fury rose like bile.|She turned and set out after the noise, fighting the seductive forces that kept telling her how nice it would be just to relax her grip on her mind and sink into a warm sea of nothingness.|Being angry, that was the thing.|She knew it was most important to stay really angry.
( 2179 ) The Discworld fell away, and lay below her as it did on the day she had been an eagle.|But this time the Circle Sea was below her-it certainly was circular, as if God had run out of ideas-and beyond it lay the arms of the continent, and the long chain of the Ramtops marching all the way to the Hub.|There were other continents she had never heard of, and tiny island chains.
( 2180 ) As her point of view changed, the Rim came into sight.|It was nighttime and, since the Disc's orbiting sun was below the world, it lit up the long waterfall that girdled the Edge.
( 2181 ) It also lit up Great A'Tuin the World Turtle.|Esk had often wondered if the Turtle was really a myth.|It seemed a lot of trouble to go to just to move a world.|But there It was, almost as big as the Disc It carried, frosted with stardust and pocked with meteor craters.
( 2182 ) Its head passed in front of her and she looked directly into an eye big enough to float all the fleets in the world.|She had heard it said that if you could look far enough into the direction that Great A'Tuin was staring, you would see the end of the universe.|Maybe it was just the set of Its beak, but Great A'Tuin looked vaguely hopeful, even optimistic.|Perhaps the end of everything wasn't as bad as all that.
( 2183 ) Dreamlike, she reached out and tried to Borrow the biggest mind in the universe.
( 2184 ) She stopped herself just in time, like a child with a toy toboggan who expected a little gentle slope and suddenly looks out of the magnificent mountains, snow-covered, stretching into the icefields of infinity.|No one would ever Borrow that mind, it would be like trying to drink all the sea.|The thoughts that moved through it were as big and as slow as glaciers.
( 2185 ) Beyond the Disc were the stars, and there was something wrong with them.|They were swirling like snowflakes.|Every now and again they would settle down and look as immobile as they always did, and then they'd suddenly take it into their heads to dance.
( 2186 ) Real stars shouldn't do that, Esk decided.|Which meant she wasn't looking at real stars.|Which meant she wasn't exactly in a real place.|But a chittering close at hand reminded her that she could almost certainly really die if she once lost track of those noises.|She turned and pursued the sounds through the stellar snowstorm.
( 2187 ) And the stars jumped, and settled, jumped, and settled...
( 2188 ) As she swooped upward Esk tried to concentrate on everyday things, because if she let her mind dwell on precisely what it was she was following then she knew she would turn back, and she wasn't sure she knew the way.|She tried to remember the eighteen herbs that cured earache, which kept her occupied for a while because she could never recall the last four.
( 2189 ) A star swooped past, and then was violently jerked away; it was about twenty feet across.
( 2190 ) When she ran out of herbs she started on the diseases of goats, which took quite a long time because goats can catch a lot of things that cows can catch plus a lot of things plus that sheep plus catch plus a complete range of horrible ailments of their very own.|When she had finished listing wooden udder, ear wilt and the octarine garget she tried to recall the complex code of dots and lines that they used to cut in the trees around Bad Ass, so that lost villagers could find their way home on snowy nights.
( 2191 ) She was only as far as dot dot dot dash dot dash (Hub-by-Turnwise, one mile from the village) when the universe around her vanished with a faint pop.|She fell forward, hit something hard and gritty and rolled to a halt.
( 2192 ) The grittiness was sand.|Fine, dry, cold sand.|You could tell that even if you dug down several feet it would be just as cold and just as dry.
( 2193 ) Esk lay with her face in it for a moment, summoning the courage to look up.|She could just see, a few feet away from her, the hem of someone's dress.|Something's dress, she corrected herself.|Unless it was a wing.|It could be a wing, a particularly tatty and leathery one.
( 2194 ) Her eyes followed it up until she found a face, higher than a house, outlined against the starry sky.|Its owner was obviously trying to look nightmarish, but had tried too hard.|The basic appearance was that of a chicken that had been dead for about two months, but the unpleasant effect was rather spoiled by warthog tusks, moth antennae, wolf ears and a unicorn spike.|The whole thing had a self-assembled look, as if the owner had heard about anatomy but couldn't quite get to grips with the idea.
( 2195 ) It was staring, but not at her.|Something behind her occupied all its interest.|Esk turned her head very slowly.
( 2196 ) Simon was sitting cross-legged in the center of a circle of Things.|There were hundreds of them, as still and silent as statues, watching him with reptilian patience.
( 2197 ) There was something small and angular held in his cupped hands.|It gave off a fuzzy blue light that made his face look strange.
( 2198 ) Other shapes lay on the ground beside him, each in its little soft glow.|They were the regular sort of shapes that Granny dismissed airily as jommetry-cubes, many-sided diamonds, cones, even a globe.|Each one was transparent and inside was...
( 2199 ) Esk edged closer.|No one was taking any notice of her.
( 2200 ) Inside a crystal sphere that had been tossed aside on to the sand floated a blue-green ball, crisscrossed with tiny white cloud patterns and what could almost have been continents if anyone was silly enough to try to live on a ball.|It might have been a sort of model, except something about its glow told Esk that it was quite real and probably very big and not-in every sense-totally inside the sphere.
( 2201 ) She put it down very gently and sidled over to a ten-sided block in which floated a much more acceptable world.|It was properly disc-shaped, but instead of the Rimfall there was a wall of ice and instead of the Hub there was a gigantic tree, so big that its roots merged into mountain ranges.
( 2202 ) A prism beside it held another slowly turning disc, surrounded by little stars.|But there were no ice walls around this one, just a red-gold thread that turned out on closer inspection to be a snake-a snake big enough to encircle a world.|For reasons best known to itself it was biting its own tail.
( 2203 ) Esk turned the prism over and over curiously, noticing how the little disc inside stayed resolutely upright.
( 2204 ) Simon giggled softly.|Esk replaced the snake-disc and peered carefully over his shoulder.
( 2205 ) He was holding a small glass pyramid.|There were stars in it, and occasionally he would give it a little shake so that the stars swirled up like snow in the wind, and then settled back in their places.|Then he would giggle.
( 2206 ) And beyond the stars...
( 2207 ) It was the Discworld.|A Great A'Tuin no bigger than a small saucer toiled along under a world that looked like the work of an obsessive jeweler.
( 2208 ) Jiggle, swirl.|Jiggle, swirl, giggle.|There were already hairline cracks in the glass.
( 2209 ) Esk looked at Simon's blank eyes and then up into the hungry faces of the nearest Things, and then she reached across and pulled the pyramid out of his hands and turned and ran.
( 2210 ) The Things didn't stir as she scurried toward them, bent almost double, with the pyramid clasped tightly to her chest.|But suddenly her feet were no longer running over the sand and she was being lifted into the frigid air, and a Thing with a face like a drowned rabbit turned slowly toward her and extended a talon.
( 2211 ) You're not really here, Esk told herself.|It's only a sort of dream, what Granny calls an annaloggy.|You can't really be hurt, it's all imagination.|There's absolutely no harm that can come to you, it's all really inside your mind.
( 2212 ) I wonder if it knows that?
( 2213 ) The talon picked her out of the air and the rabbit face split like a banana skin.|There was no mouth, just a dark hole, as if the Thing was itself an opening to an even worse dimension, a place by comparison with which freezing sand and moonless moonlight would be a jolly afternoon at the seaside.
( 2214 ) Esk held the Disc-pyramid and flailed with her free hand at the claw around her.|It had no effect.|The darkness loomed over her, a gateway to total oblivion.
( 2215 ) She kicked it as hard as she could.
( 2216 ) Which was not, given the circumstances, very hard.|But where her foot struck there was an explosion of white sparks and a pop-which would have been a much more satisfying bang if the thin air here didn't suck the sound away.
( 2217 ) The Thing screeched like a chainsaw encountering, deep inside an unsuspecting sapling, a lurking and long-forgotten nail.|The others around it set up a sympathetic buzzing.
( 2218 ) Esk kicked again and the Thing shrieked and dropped her to the sand.|She was bright enough to roll, with the tiny world hugged protectively to her, because even in a dream a broken ankle can be painful.
( 2219 ) The Thing lurched uncertainly above her.|Esk's eyes narrowed.|She put the world down very carefully, hit the Thing very hard around the point where its shins would be, if there were shins under that cloak, and picked up the world again in one neat movement.
( 2220 ) The creature howled, bent double, and then toppled slowly, like a sackful of coat hangers.|When it hit the ground it collapsed into a mass of disjointed limbs; the head rolled away and rocked to a standstill.
( 2221 ) Is that all?|thought Esk.|They can hardly walk, even!|When you hit them they just fall over?
( 2222 ) The nearest Things chittered and tried to back away as she marched determinedly toward them, but since their bodies seemed to be held together more or less by wishful thinking they weren't very good at it.|She hit one, which had a face like a small family of squid, and it deflated into a pile of twitching bones and bits of fur and odd ends of tentacle, very much like a Greek meal.|Another was slightly more successful and had begun to shamble uncertainly away before Esk caught it a crack on one of its five shins.
( 2223 ) It flailed desperately as it fell and brought down another two.
( 2224 ) By then the others had managed to lurch out of her way and stood watching from a distance.
( 2225 ) Esk took a few steps toward the nearest one.|It tried to move away, and fell over.
( 2226 ) They may have been ugly.|They may have been evil.|But when it came to poetry in motion, the Things had all the grace and coordination of a deck-chair.
( 2227 ) Esk glared at them, and took a look at the Disc in its glass pyramid.|All the excitement didn't seem to have disturbed it a bit.
( 2228 ) She'd been able to get out, if this indeed was out and if the Disc could be said to be in.|But how was one supposed to get back?
( 2229 ) Somebody laughed.|It was the sort of laugh-
( 2230 ) Basically, it was p'ch'zarni'chiwkov.|This epiglottis-throt-tling word is seldom used on the Disc except by highly paid stunt linguists and, of course, the tiny tribe of the K'turni, who invented it.|It has no direct synonym, although the Cumhoolie word "squernt" ("the feeling upon finding that the previous occupant of the privy has used all the paper") begins to approach it in general depth of feeling.|The closest translation is as follows:
CUMHOOLIE :	 squernt the feeling upon finding that the previous occupant of the privy has used all the paper

( 2231 ) the nasty little sound of a sword being unsheathed right behind one at just the point when one thought one had disposed of one's enemies
( 2232 ) -although K'turni speakers say that this does not convey the cold sweating, heart-stopping, gut-freezing sense of the original.
( 2233 ) It was that kind of laugh.
( 2234 ) Esk turned around slowly.|Simon drifted toward her across the sand, with his hands cupped in front of him.|His eyes were tight shut.
( 2235 ) "Did you really think it would be as easy as that?"|he said.|Or something said; it didn't sound like Simon's voice, but like dozens of voices speaking at once.

( 2240 ) The face in front of her opened its eyes.|There was nothing there but blackness-not a color, just holes into some other space.

( 2259 ) Esk glanced sideways at the distant mountains, sprawled on the chilly horizon like melted mud pies.|There were no trees, not even any rocks.|Just sand and cold stars and-
( 2260 ) She felt the movement rather than heard it and turned with the pyramid held between her hands like a club.|It hit the Simon-thing in midleap with a satisfying thump, but as soon as it hit the ground it somersaulted forward and bounced upright with unpleasant ease.|But it had heard her gasp and had seen the brief pain in her eyes.|It paused.
( 2261 ) "Ah, that hurt you, did it not?|You don't like to see another one suffer, yes?|Not this one, it seems."
SIMON-THING :	 Ah , that hurt you , did it not ? You do n't like to see another one suffer , yes ? Not this one , it seems .

( 2262 ) It turned and beckoned, and two of the tall Things lurched over to it and gripped it firmly by the arms.
( 2263 ) Its eyes changed.|The darkness faded, and then Simon's own eyes looked out of his face.|He stared up at the Things on either side of him and struggled briefly, but one had several pairs of tentacles wrapped around his wrist and the other was holding his arm in the world's largest lobster claw.
( 2264 ) Then he saw Esk, and his eyes fell to the little glass pyramid.
( 2265 ) "Run away!"|he hissed.|"Take it away from here!|Don't let them get it!"|He grimaced as the claw tightened on his arm.

ESK :	 How do I know I can trust you ?
mentioned_person ['Listen'] recent_person: Simon Simon Esk she she

( 2284 ) YOU CAN'T TRUST US.|BUT YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.
( 2285 ) Esk looked at the ring of faces that not even a necrophile could love, faces put together from a fishmonger's midden, faces picked randomly from things that lurked in deep ocean holes and haunted caves, faces that were not human enough to gloat or leer but had all the menace of a suspiciously V-shaped ripple near an incautious bather.
( 2286 ) She couldn't trust them.|But she had no choice.
( 2287 ) Something else was happening, in a place as far away as the thickness of a shadow.
( 2288 ) The student wizards had run back to the Great Hall, where Cutangle and Granny Weatherwax were still locked in the magical equivalent of Indian arm wrestling.|The flagstones under Granny were half-melted and cracked and the table behind Cutangle had taken root and already bore a rich crop of acorns.
( 2289 ) One of the students had earned several awards for bravery by daring to tug at Cutangle's cloak...
( 2290 ) And now they were crowded into the narrow room, looking at the two bodies.
( 2291 ) Cutangle summoned doctors of the body and doctors of the mind, and the room buzzed with magic as they got to work.
( 2292 ) Granny tapped him on the shoulder.
( 2293 ) "A word in your ear, young man," she said.
GRANNY :	 A word in your ear , young man ,

( 2294 ) "Hardly young, madam," sighed Cutangle, "hardly young."|He felt drained.|It had been decades since he'd dueled in magic, although it was common enough among students.|He had a nasty feeling that Granny would have won eventually.|Fighting her was like swatting a fly on your own nose.|He couldn't think what had come over him to try it.
IT :	 Hardly young , madam , hardly young .

( 2295 ) Granny led him out into the passage and around the corner to a window seat.|She sat down, leaning her broomstick against the wall.|Rain drummed heavily on the roofs outside, and a few zigzags of lightning indicated a storm of Ramtop proportions approaching the city.
( 2296 ) "That was quite an impressive display," she said: "You nearly won once or twice there."
RAMTOP :	 That was quite an impressive display , You nearly won once or twice there .

( 2298 ) Granny nodded.
( 2299 ) Cutangle patted at various bits of his robe until he located a tarry bag of tobacco and a roll of paper.|His hands shook as he fumbled a few shreds of secondhand pipeweed into a skinny homemade.|He ran the wretched thing across his tongue, and barely moistened it.|Then a dim remembrance of propriety welled up in the back of his mind.
( 2300 ) "Um," he said, "do you mind if I smoke?"
IT :	 Um , do you mind if I smoke ?

( 2301 ) Granny shrugged.|Cutangle struck a match on the wall and tried desperately to navigate the flame and the cigarette into approximately the same position.|Granny gently took the match from his trembling hand and lit it for him.
( 2302 ) Cutangle sucked on the tobacco, had a ritual cough and settled back, the glowing end of the rollup the only light in the dim corridor.
( 2303 ) "They've gone Wandering," said Granny at last.

( 2309 ) There was a pause while they contemplated what might come back, inhabiting living bodies, acting almost like the original inhabitants.
( 2310 ) "It's probably my fault-" they said in unison, and stopped in astonishment.

( 2313 ) Cutangle opened his mouth to point out very courteously that tobacco was a habit reserved for wizards, but thought better of it.|He extended the tobacco pouch toward Granny.
( 2314 ) She told him about Esk's birth, and the coming of the old wizard, and the staff, and Esk's forays into magic.|By the time she had finished she had succeeded in rolling a tight, thin cylinder that burned with a small blue flame and made her eyes water.

( 2325 ) There are storms that are frankly theatrical, all sheet lightning and metallic thunder rolls.|There are storms that are tropical and sultry, and incline to hot winds and fireballs.|But this was a storm of the Circle Sea plains, and its main ambition was to hit the ground with as much rain as possible.|It was the kind of storm that suggests that the whole sky has swallowed a diuretic.|The thunder and lightning hung around in the background, supplying a sort of chorus, but the rain was the star of the show.|It tap-danced across the land.
( 2326 ) The grounds of the University stretched right down to the river.|By day they were a neat formal pattern of gravel paths and hedges, but in the middle of a wet wild night the hedges seemed to have moved and the paths had simply gone off somewhere to stay dry.
( 2327 ) A weak wyrdlight shone inefficiently among the dripping leaves.|But most of the rain found its way through anyway.

( 2334 ) Granny Weatherwax peered through the soaking darkness.|She could hear a roaring and could dimly make out the white crests of floodwater.|There was also the distinctive river smell of the Ankh, which suggested that several armies had used it first as a urinal and then as a sepulcher.
( 2335 ) Cutangle splashed dejectedly toward her.

( 2385 ) Cutangle nodded.|He felt that the last couple of hours had somehow carried him along without him actually touching the sides, and for a moment he nursed the strangely consoling feeling that his life was totally beyond his control and whatever happened no one could blame him.|Filling his boots with water while adrift on a flooded river at midnight with what he could only describe as a woman seemed about as logical as anything could be in the circumstances.
( 2386 ) A fine figure of a woman, said a neglected voice at the back of his mind.|There was something about the way she used the tattered broomstick to scull the boat across the choppy water that troubled long-forgotten bits of Cutangle's subconscious.

( 2541 ) Rain gushed across the leads of Unseen University and poured into the gutters where ravens" nests, abandoned since the summer, floated like very badly built boats.|The water gurgled along ancient, crusted pipes.|It found its way under tiles and said hallo to the spiders under the eaves.|It leapt from gables and formed secret lakes high amongst the spires.
( 2542 ) Whole ecologies lived in the endless rooftops of the University, which by comparison made Gormenghast look like a toolshed on a railway allotment; birds sang in tiny jungles grown from apple pips and weed seeds, little frogs swam in the upper gutters, and a colony of ants were busily inventing an interesting and complex civilization.
( 2543 ) One thing the water couldn't do was gurgle out of the ornamental gargoyles ranged around the roofs.|This was because the gargoyles wandered off and sheltered in the attics at the first sign of rain.|They held that just because you were ugly it didn't mean you were stupid.
( 2544 ) It rained streams.|It rained rivers.|It rained seas.|But mainly it rained through the roof of the Great Hall, where the duel between Granny and Cutangle had left a very large hole, and Treatle felt that it was somehow raining on him personally.
( 2545 ) He stood on a table organizing the teams of students who were taking down the paintings and ancient tapestries before they got soaked.|It had to be a table, because the floor was already several inches deep in water.
( 2546 ) Not rainwater, unfortunately.|This was water with real personality, the kind of distinctive character water gets after a long journey through silty countryside.|It had the thick texture of authentic Ankh water-too stiff to drink, too runny to plough.
( 2547 ) The river had burst its banks and a million little water-courses were flowing backward, bursting in through the cellars and playing peek-a-boo under the flagstones.|There was the occasional distant boom as some forgotten magic in a drowned dungeon shorted out and surrendered up its power; Treatle wasn't at all keen on some of the unpleasant bubblings and hissings that were escaping to the surface.
( 2548 ) He thought again how nice it would be to be the sort of wizard who lived in a little cave somewhere and collected herbs and thought significant thoughts and knew what the owls were saying.|But probably the cave would be damp and the herbs would be poisonous and Treatle could never be sure, when all was said and done, exactly what thoughts were really significant.
( 2549 ) He got down awkwardly and paddled through the dark swirling waters.|Well, he had done his best.|He'd tried to organize the senior wizards into repairing the roof by magic, but there was a general argument over the spells that could be used and a consensus that this was in any case work for artisans.
( 2550 ) That's wizards for you, he thought gloomily as he waded between the dripping arches, always probing the infinite but never noticing the definite, especially in the matter of household chores.|We never had this trouble before that woman came.
( 2551 ) He squelched up the steps, lit by a particularly impressive flash of lightning.|He had a cold certainty that while of course no one could possibly blame him for all this, everybody would.|He seized the hem of his robe and wrung it out wretchedly, then he reached for his tobacco pouch.
( 2552 ) It was a nice green waterproof one.|That meant that all the rain that had got into it couldn't get out again.|It was indescribable.
( 2553 ) He found his little clip of papers.|They were fused into one lump, like the legendary pound note found in the back pockets of trousers after they have been washed, spun, dried and ironed.

( 2556 ) Treatle looked around.|He had been the last to leave the hall, where even now some of the benches were beginning to float.|Whirlpools and patches of bubble marked the spots where magic was leaking from the cellars, but there was no one to be seen.
( 2557 ) Unless, of course, one of the statues had spoken.|They had been too heavy to move, and Treatle remembered telling the students that a thorough wash would probably do them good.
( 2558 ) He looked at their stern faces and regretted it.|The statues of very powerful dead mages were sometimes more lifelike than statues had any right to be.|Maybe he should have kept his voice down.
( 2559 ) "Yes?"|he ventured, acutely aware of the stony stares.

( 2569 ) "A witch has got to have a hat, otherwise who's to know?"|said Granny.|She made a grab as something dark and sodden drifted by, cackled triumphantly, tipped out the water and rammed the hat on her head.|It had lost its stiffening and flopped rather rakishly over one eye.

( 2584 ) Treatle watched them go, with his mouth hanging open.|When their footsteps had died away in the distance he stood silently for a moment, thinking about life and where his could have gone wrong.
( 2585 ) However, he wasn't going to be accused of disobedience.
( 2586 ) Very carefully, without knowing exactly why, he reached out and gave the wall a friendly pat.

( 2588 ) Strangely enough, he felt a lot better.
( 2589 ) It occurred to Cutangle that he ought to lead the way in his own premises, but Granny in a hurry was no match for a near-terminal nicotine addict and he kept up only by a sort of crabwise leaping.

( 2596 ) She swept past a trio of astonished wizards, who were surprised by her and completely startled by her hat.
( 2597 ) Cutangle panted after her and caught her arm at the doors to the library.

( 2604 ) The library was full of wizards, who care about their books in the same way that ants care about their eggs and in time of difficulty carry them around in much the same way.|The water was getting in even here, and turning up in rather odd places because of the library's strange gravitational effects.|All the lower shelves had been cleared and relays of wizards and students were pilling the volumes on every available table and dry shelf.|The air was full of the sound of angry rustling pages, which almost drowned out the distant fury of the storm.

( 2657 ) The following thoughts sped through Cutangle's mind:
( 2658 ) ...It doesn't say it anywhere, it says it everywhere.
( 2659 ) ...But young Simon seemed to say that everywhere is much like nowhere that you can't really tell the difference.
( 2660 ) ...Do I want to be remembered as the first Archchancellor to allow women into the University?|Still...I'd be remembered that's for sure.

( 2667 ) She couldn't trust them.|But she had no choice.
( 2668 ) Esk stared at the terrible faces peering down at her, and the lanky bodies, mercifully cloaked.
( 2669 ) Her hands tingled.
( 2670 ) In the shadow-world, ideas are real.|The thought seemed to travel up her arms.
( 2671 ) It was a buoyant sort of thought, a thought full of fizz.|She laughed, and moved her hands apart, and the staff sparkled in her hands like solid electricity.
( 2672 ) The Things started to chitter nervously and one or two at the back started to lurch away.|Simon fell forward as his captor hastily let go, and he landed on his hands and knees in the sand.

( 2683 ) She moved her hands together and the staff vanished, although for a moment her hands glowed as though they were cupped around a candle.

( 2699 ) The Things ahead of them fell over each other in their haste to back away.

( 2712 ) Cutangle lit his third rollup from the stub of the second.|This last cigarette owed a lot to the creative powers of nervous energy, and looked like a camel with the legs cut off.
( 2713 ) He had already watched the staff lift itself gently from Esk and land on Simon.
( 2714 ) Now it had floated up into the air again.
( 2715 ) Other wizards had crowded into the room.|The librarian was sitting under the table.
( 2716 ) "If only we had some idea what is going on," said Cutangle.|"It's the suspense I can't stand."

( 2718 ) As one man the assembled college of wizards turned their faces toward Cutangle, expectantly.
( 2719 ) He took the smoldering mess out of his mouth and, with a glare that none of the assembled wizards cared to meet, trod it underfoot.
( 2720 ) "Probably time I gave it up anyway," he said.|"That goes for the rest of you, too.|Worse than an ashpit in this place, sometimes."

( 2721 ) Then he saw the staff.|It was-
( 2722 ) The only way Cutangle could describe the effect was that it seemed to be going very fast while staying in exactly the same place.
( 2723 ) Streamers of gas flared away from it and vanished, if they were gas.|It blazed like a comet designed by an inept special effects man.|Colored sparks leapt out and disappeared somewhere.
( 2724 ) It was also changing color, starting with a dull red and then climbing through the spectrum until it was a painful violet.|Snakes of white fire coruscated along its length.
( 2725 ) (There should be a word for words that sound like things would sound like if they made a noise, he thought.|The word "glisten" does indeed gleam oilily, and if there was ever a word that sounded exactly the way sparks look as they creep across burned paper, or the way the lights of cities would creep across the world if the whole of human civilization was crammed into one night, then you couldn't do better than "coruscate.")

( 2728 ) In total silence, in the kind of silence in fact that sucks in sounds and stifles them, the staff flashed into pure octarine along the whole of its length.
( 2729 ) The eighth color, produced by light falling through a strong magical field, blazed out through bodies and bookshelves and walls.|Other colors blurred and ran together, as though the light was a glass of gin poured over the watercolor painting of the world.|The clouds over the University glowed, twisted into fascinating and unexpected shapes, and streamed upward.
( 2730 ) An observer above the Disc would have seen a little patch of land near the Circle Sea sparkle like a jewel for several seconds, then wink out.
( 2731 ) The silence of the room was broken by a wooden clatter as the staff dropped out of the air and bounced on the table.

( 2741 ) "Everyone try and reach out," said Cutangle, and choked down a scream as a hand like a warm leather glove closed around his ankle.|There was a satisfied little "ook," which managed to convey relief, comfort and the sheer joy of touching a fellow human being or, in this case, anthropoid.

( 2782 ) The river was still brown and swollen but at least it resembled a river again.
( 2783 ) It was unnaturally hot for late autumn, and across the whole of the lower part of Ankh-Morpork the steam rose from thousands of carpets and blankets put out to dry.|The streets were filled with silt, which on the whole was an improvement-Ankh-Morpork's impressive civic collection of dead dogs had been washed out to sea.
( 2784 ) The steam also rose from the flagstones of the Archchancellor's personal verandah, and from the teapot on the table.
( 2785 ) Granny lay back in an ancient cane chair and let the unseasonal warmth creep around her ankles.|She idly watched a team of city ants, who had lived under the flagstones of the University for so long that the high levels of background magic had permanently altered their genes, anthandling a damp sugar lump down from the bowl on to a tiny trolley.|Another group was erecting a matchstick gantry at the edge of the table.
